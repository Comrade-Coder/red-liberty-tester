 ### Anarchism ###
 anarchism_subtype:0 "Anarchism"
 anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "Anarchism is a political philosophy which advocates the abolition of all unjust hierarchy, as well as the destruction of oppressive structures such as governments, capitalism, and bigotry. Insurrectionary Anarchism differs from other strains of anarchist thought because it puts these principles into direct action, not via policy or reform but by immediate, violent revolt against all authority. Insurrectionary Anarchists will rarely ever negotiate with state authorities, and tend towards being deliberately chaotic and militaristic."
 
 anarcho_socialism_subtype:0 "Social Anarchism"
 anarcho_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§YSocial Anarchism§! is a political ideology that advocates for the abolition of all forms of hierarchical authority, including the state, capitalism, and organized religion. It emphasizes the importance of individual freedom and autonomy, as well as the importance of community and mutual aid. Social anarchists believe in the decentralization of power and the organization of society based on voluntary associations, direct democracy, and collective decision-making. They often advocate for the creation of self-managed, cooperative enterprises, as well as the defense of individual and collective rights."
 
 ### Vanguard Socialism ###
 vanguard_socialism_subtype:0 "Vanguard Socialism"
 vanguard_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Whilst Marx's material contributions to the worldwide socialist movement have been fundamental to shaping socialist thought in the 20th century, the vagueness with regards to the ways in which to establish such a system required further ideological channeling, leading to the idea that a firm hand is not only ideal, but of a necessity, in order to promulgate and affirm the people's state, with a vanguard party, viewing the inherent contradictions in which people vote against their class interests, leading the charge instead of relying on broad popular support. In the eyes of these autocratic socialists, they wear this bandana with pride, seeing that only they, given the indoctrination of the masses, can upset the status quo, and viewing blind acts of vandalism and or revolution as anti-dialectical, requiring strict planning and coordination through the use of mass politics and democratic centralist organisations."
 
 leninism_subtype:0 "Leninism"
 leninism_subtype_desc:0 "§YLeninism§! is a political theory and practice developed by Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolsheviks, which emphasizes the need for a highly disciplined revolutionary party to lead the working class in a socialist revolution. Leninism also emphasizes the importance of centralized control over the economy and the state, as well as the use of violence and coercion to achieve political goals. In the short time it has existed, it has already had a significant influence on Marxist thought and revolutionary movements around the world."
 
 bolshevik_leninism_subtype:0 "Bolshevik-Leninism"
 bolshevik_leninism_subtype_desc:0 "Better known to the world as Trotskyism, §YBolshevik-Leninism§! is the strain of Leninist thought advocated for by Soviet political theorist Lev Trotsky. Criticizing the Soviet government from a left position, it emphasizes vanguardism, proletarian internationalism, and the improtance of central economic planning. Most important, however, is Trotsky's theory of permanent revolution; wherein the revolutionary working class must pursue its own interests independently, and without compromise or alliance with the bourgeoisie."

 right_communism_subtype:0 "Right Communism"
 right_communism_subtype_desc:0 "§YRight Communism§!, also termed "Bukharinism" by its many detractors, and "Bolshevism" by its followers, represents a more moderate and pragmatic approach to socialism within the context of the Soviet government. Largely theorized by Nikolai Bukharin, it emphasizes the importance of economic planning and gradual transition to socialism, in contrast to more radical revolutionary methods advocated by other Bolshevik leaders like Lenin and Trotsky. In practice, this has thus far meant continued support for the New Economic Policy, and the coexistence of state-owned and private enterprises."
 
 revolutionary_autocracy_subtype:0 "Revolutionary Autocracy"
 revolutionary_autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "§YRevolutionary Autocracy§! is an interpretation of Marxist theory which views the Dictatorship of the Proletariat as a license to create an extremely authoritarian and repressive state. Usually ruled by a political vanguard party by means of secret police, military force, and purges, Revolutionary Autocracies are extremely centralized both politically and economically, often ruled by a single leader, and use Marxist thought as the justification for their rule. They often tend toward social conservatism, and no democracy is practiced within such states."
 
 ### Revolutionary Socialism ###
 revolutionary_socialism_subtype:0 "Revolutionary Socialism"
 revolutionary_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Seeking to gather and mobilize broad support of the masses, and to tear down the status quo through revolutionary fervour, these radical socialists, first stemming from the ideas of the Narodniks in Russia and further formulated through Pyotr Tkachev, view the necessity of mob violence and or a combination of mass popular support from the oppressed worker and peasant classes as a prerequisite to achieving their aims. Although having a rather violent outlook on ways in which to establish their form of governance, revolutionary socialists are rather flexible when it comes to the way in which to govern such a state post revolution, with even some democratic socialist doctrines, such as council communists, who argue for a lenient body to govern once the state apparatus has been seized, but all share to common view that in order to get to that point, violence, coordinated or uncoordinated, is a necessary first step for such a task."
 
 proletarian_dictatorship_subtype:0 "Proletarian Dictatorship"
 proletarian_dictatorship_subtype_desc:0 "Favored by most Orthodox Marxists, Communists, and Leninists, the §YProletarian Dictatorship§! is a form of government ruled by a vanguard party, which is educated on the doctrines of Marxism and Communism, and leads with a high degree of political and economic centralization, often with a high degree of central planning. Proletarian Dictatorships usually include a restricted form of democracy, such as party membership-based voting, democratic centralism, or limits on acceptable speech."
 
 syndicalism_subtype:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§YSyndicalism§! is a radical political ideology that advocates for the organization of workers into labor unions (or syndicates) to directly challenge and eventually replace both capitalism and the state. It emphasizes direct action, industrial strikes, and grassroots organizing as means to achieve social change. Syndicalists aim to create a society where workers collectively control and manage industries and services, eliminating the need for both traditional capitalist ownership and centralized government control."
 
 de_leonism_subtype:0 "Marxism-De Leonism"
 de_leonism_subtype_desc:0 "§YMarxism-De Leonism§! is a libertarian Marxist current developed in the 1890s by the American activist and theoretician Daniel De Leon. As a co-founder of the Industrial Workers of the World, he is regarded as the forefather of revolutionary industrial unionism, his ideas having influence in not just the United States, but across much of the British Empire as well. While sharing some characteristics of anarcho-syndicalism, De Leonism actually differs from it in that De Leonism, and its proponents, still believe in the necessity of a political party advocating a Constitutional amendment making the Union the government of industry."
 
 scientific_socialism_subtype:0 "Scientific Socialism"
 scientific_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "While socialism itself is primarily based off of the principles of democracy and bottom-up social organization, scientific socialism adds a belief in, and in extreme cases a downright reverence for science into the mix. Scientific socialism seeks to create a logical, rational society of well-educated, free-thinking proletarians, who all work together for scientific progress. In practice, this takes the form of a sort of socialist technocracy in which the most capable and scientifically literate rise to positions of prominence."

 ### Democratic Socialism ###
 democratic_socialism_subtype:0 "Democratic Socialism"
 democratic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Valuing freedom and the will of the people in combination with steps toward a socially-owned economy, §YDemocratic Socialism§! is a form of Socialism which posits that the Capitalist system and the social inequality it brings is inherently incompatible with true freedom. Believing rather that economic equality and wealth amongst all citizens are required for liberty and personal autonomy, democratic socialists often pursue the building of socialism through gradual democratic change and referendum."
 
 libertarian_socialism_subtype:0 "Libertarian Socialism"
 libertarian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "The most moderate of the socialist schools of thought, §YLibertarian Socialism§! includes many socialist governments which adopt a less centralized system both politically and economically. Engaging in full-franchise, often direct, democracy and with economies led by either collective or market forces rather than central planning, Libertarian Socialist governments tend to be smaller than other leftist ones. They also tend to be socially progressive, and may include anarchists, communists, socialists, and syndicalists."
 
 christian_socialism_subtype:0 "Christian Socialism"
 christian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Characterised by the blending of Socialist economic doctrine with Christian morality and philosophy, §YChristian Socialism§! is an ideology in which Biblical principles and worker liberation go hand-in-hand. Common among theologians and their followers, Christian Socialists often preach that Capitalism is in itself a sinful system, promoting greed and idolatry, and that communal living and social equality under a Socialist government are more in tune with God’s will."
 
 islamic_socialism_subtype:0 "Islamic Socialism"
 islamic_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Among the Five Pillars of Islam, there stands the Zakat; the duty of almsgiving. Just as ablutions purify the body and salat purifies the soul, so zakat purifies possessions. One's ill-gotten capital gains may be, in a way, 'purified' by giving to the less fortunate. Islamic socialists believe that the teachings of the Quran and Muhammad — zakat in particular — are not only compatible with principles of socialism, but also supportive of them. Leaders of the movement believe in the creation of a popular government based on social welfare, equality, and communal ownership."
 
 agrarian_socialism_subtype:0 "Agrarian Socialism"
 agrarian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§YAgrarian Socialism§! is a political ideology which combines an agrarian way of life with a socialist economic system. When compared to standard socialist movements which are generally urban, industrial, and progressive, many agrarian socialist movements have tended to be rural, locally focused, and traditional. Similar to their capitalist counterparts in their advocacy for decentralization, agrarian socialists advocate for non-state forms of collective ownership, placing their emphasis instead on social control and ownership of the means of production in a rural society."
 
 austromarxism_subtype:0 "Austromarxism"
 austromarxism_subtype_desc:0 "A uniquely Austrian flavor of socialism, §YAustromarxism§! perfectly encapsulates the unique circumstances of the empire in which it was born. Austromarxists strive to achieve a synthesis between social democracy and revolutionary socialism; a middle road, with class consciousness acheived though the maintenance of national autonomy. Austromarxists believe in the importance of political pluralism, civil liberties, and social welfare programs, as well as the need for workers' self-management and control over the means of production. They reject the centralized, authoritarian approach of Soviet-style communism and instead seek to create a socialism that is more responsive to the needs and aspirations of ordinary people."
 
 ### Social Democracy ###
 social_democracy_subtype:0 "Social Democracy"
 social_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "The furthest left among liberal views, §YSocial Democracy§! adheres generally to a belief in market economics and allows private ownership, but believes in a much larger government than other liberals. Social Democrats argue for extensive welfare states and government programs of regulation and occasionally nationalization to protect and care for their citizens. They also tend towards social progressivism and, despite their nominal support of private enterprise, often align with further-left groups."
 
 sewer_socialism_subtype:0 "Constructive Socialism"
 sewer_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Hailing from Milwaukee, where the term was originally used as an insult, §YSewer Socialism§! is a primarily social-democratic system based upon pragmatism and public outreach. Rejecting calls for revolution of any kind based on their belief that they lack the public support to fully overthrow capitalism, Sewer Socialists prefer to make gains where they can, passing laws to make workers' lives better in material ways, such as setting minimum wages, enforcing safe working conditions, regulating working hours, and using local governments to provide amenities like running water, electricity, and sewer systems to working class areas. Radicals often scoff that Sewer Socialists aren't doing enough to overthrow capitalism, but their short-term benefits for the welfare of the working class are hard to ignore."

 social_corporatism_subtype_desc:0 "§YSocial Corporatism§! is a political and economic system that seeks to reconcile the interests of capital and labor through structured and institutionalized cooperation. It involves the creation of legally recognized organizations, such as unions and employer associations, that represent the interests of workers and business owners in negotiations with the government. Social corporatism also emphasizes the importance of social welfare programs, including health care, education, and housing, as well as the regulation of markets to ensure economic stability and fairness."
 
 ### Progressive Liberalism ###
 progressive_liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "Defined by their social progressivism and economic capitalism, §YProgressive Liberals§! adhere closely to the classical origins of liberal thought. They believe in enlightenment values such as liberty and equality, and believe the government should play a role in ensuring the equality of various groups, including women, racial minorities, and immigrants. They also are staunch capitalists, believing that the free market and private enterprise will bring growth and development to underprivileged communities."

 jadidism_subtype:0 "Jadidism"
 jadidism_subtype_desc:0 "Central Asian §YJadidism§! first emerged in the Russian Empire as a result of several reformist and progressivist movements in the Islamic regions of the empire. Inspired by anti-colonial developments in India, the movement took it's name from 'osul-e jadid' which literally means 'new method'. They believe that Islam has to distance itself from the 'qadim' - the old and traditionalist methods and embrace new ways to catch up with the rest of the world. This however, is not the same as neglecting Islamic culture like poetry and carpetry, but instead, modernizing and keeping up with the rest of the world."

It is not enough to just seek liberty, one must have equality as well. Though most significant in its birthplace of France, radical parties can be found all over the world, especially in South America."
 
 ### Liberal Conservatism ###
 liberal_conservatism_subtype:0 "Liberal Conservatism"
 liberal_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "§YLiberal Conservatism§! is a political ideology combining conservative policies with liberal stances, especially on economic, social and ethical issues. Adherents take the classical-liberal view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference. However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life; therefore, a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order, and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation."
 
 national_liberalism_subtype:0 "National Liberalism"
 national_liberalism_subtype_desc:0 "§YNational Liberalism§! is a variant of liberalism, combining liberal policies and issues with elements of nationalism. The stated goals of a national liberal are the pursuit of individual and economic freedom, as well as national sovereignty. Although pro-business, national liberals are not necessarily advocates of free trade and economic liberalism per se, and sometimes advocate cooperation between the government and the national industry, moderate levels of protectionism, the establishment of preferential custom unions, subsidies for infant industry or companies considered of national strategic importance, and various forms of industrial planning."
 
 market_libertarianism_subtype:0 "Market Libertarianism"
 market_libertarianism_subtype_desc:0 "Second only to anarchists in their distaste for government power, §YMarket Libertarians§! view the free market as the ultimate solution to all problems, be they economic or political. Usually pushing for reductions in taxes, spending, and regulation by the government, they put their faith instead in the influence of market forces and corporations. Market Libertarians tend to be fairly apathetic towards social issues, though they may lean one way or another. Ultimately, their primary concerns are with the freedom of the market."
 
 agrarianism_subtype:0 "Agrarianism"
 agrarianism_subtype_desc:0 "§YAgrarianism§! is a political and social philosophy promoting subsistence agriculture, smallholdings, and egalitarianism, with agrarian political parties normally supporting the rights and sustainability of small farmers and poor peasants against the wealthy in society. Somewhat contradictory in nature, they are against regulation, yet are pro-environment, they are supporters of traditional family structures, yet often advocate radical democratic reform. Not limited to just centrist politics, socialists as well as conservatives and even nationalists have all adopted aspects of agrarianism in their policies."
 
 ### National Conservatism ###
 national_conservatism_subtype:0 "National Conservatism"
 national_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "The furthest right of the liberal ideologies, §YNational Conservatism§! advocates traditional values, conservative social policy, and nationalistic culture and foreign policy. Usually favoring a capitalist free market with a strong government to protect against other countries, National Conservatives are nationalists first and foremost. They usually oppose social change and immigration, and are skeptical of other nations and cultures. They still nominally support ideas of equality and democracy, however."
 
 christian_democracy_subtype:0 "Christian Democracy"
 christian_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "§YChristian Democracy§! is a political ideology that seeks to integrate Christian values and principles into democratic governance. It emphasizes the importance of human dignity, solidarity, subsidiarity, and the common good. Christian Democrats often advocate for social welfare programs and a strong civil society, while also promoting free markets and individual rights. They also tend to support traditional family values and a strong national identity."
 
 conservative_populism_subtype:0 "Populist Conservatism"
 conservative_populism_subtype_desc:0 "Though proponents of §YPopulist Conservatism§! oppose the introduction of reforms, their position is drawn from a belief that society's ills are the result of a bloated bureaucracy, not the reform or the system itself. The populist conservative will say, "Reforms are merely a way that the useless career politician justifies his job. It is also precisely what is ruining our country!" A populist conservative regime would look much like other conservative regimes, with an added focus on cutting bloat, cutting taxes, and courting the masses. Any actual reforms passed would be geared more towards maintaining the status quo."
 
 paternalistic_conservatism_subtype:0 "Paternalistic Conservatism"
 paternalistic_conservatism_subtype_desc:0 "Seeking to establish harmony between the social classes, Paternalistic Conservatism argues that the privileged members of a society have a duty to care for the poor and destitute around them. In this endeavour, it supports the existence of small social safety nets, and government intervention to curb the worst excesses of capitalism. Though broadly against radical social change, some conservatives have come to support the expansion of women's and minority rights when they deem necessary."
 
 ### Authoritarian Democracy ###
 authoritarian_democracy_subtype_desc:0 "Professing the values of democracy and liberty, but practicing an authoritarian, undemocratic political style, §YAuthoritarian Democracy§! is a contradictory but very common mode of political organizing. The military, a strongman, a populist, or some other political force has suspended civil liberties and operates with unchecked power in a civil dictatorship, running only a sham of democracy, while justifying it with democratic rhetoric, such as "protecting democracy," "maintaining order," and "for national security.""

Fascists saw the Great War as a revolution that brought massive changes to the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants, and a military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens."

As a result, religious doctrine is given equal or more importance than orthodox fascist doctrine. Naturally, clerical fascists vehemently endorse conservative social positions on gender roles, the position of minorities, and labor rights, and promote the primacy of religious institutions. Although this particular brand of fascism originated amongst Catholics in Italy, it does not necessarily have to be Catholic, or even Christian."

Kita also asserted Japan's right as an 'international proletariat' to conquer Siberia, the Russian Far East, and Australia, arguing that in order to confront western imperialism and economic stagnation, Japan should embark on its own path of imperialism. Despite the many promises of human and labor rights, Kita's militaristic and fascistic-oriented 'socialism from above' has been the inspiration for many in the Japanese far-right."
 
 german_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Seeing its origins in the writings of Oswald Spengler, §YGerman Socialism§! is a strange, eclectic ideology. Spengler claimed that socialistic Prussian characteristics existed across Germany that included creativity, discipline, concern for the greater good, productivity, and self-sacrifice. Unlike other socialists, Spengler denounced Marxism for having developed socialism from an English perspective, while not understanding Germans' socialist nature. True socialism according to Spengler would take the form of a corporatism, in which local corporate bodies organized according to the importance of each occupation to the people as a whole; higher representation in stages up to a supreme council of the state; there would be no organized parties, no professional politicians, no periodic elections.\n\nSpenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment. All this resulted in a form of socialism that was decidedly capitalist, and very right-wing."
