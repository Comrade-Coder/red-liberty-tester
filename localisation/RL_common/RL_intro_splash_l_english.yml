 AHE_country_intro_desc_1:0 "The year is 1919, and the §YGreat War§! has come to an end.\n\nIn §YBerlin§!, parades of prideful Germans march under the Imperial banner, overjoyed to have finally brought the conflict to an end, and in their favor no-less.\n\nIn §YVienna§!, the story is very different. The streets are eerily quiet. A generation of sons, husbands, and fathers who inhabited the once-great city have departed to the afterlife, taken by the great conflict which sapped so much from the world. The people are not overjoyed by the news of victory. They are relieved, certainly, but the affair leaves a bitter taste in the mouths of those who sacrificed so much, and seemed to gain so, so little."
 
 USA_country_intro_desc_1:0 "At the turn of the century, the §3United States of America§! was in the throes of a great war. There was no declaration of hostilities, there were no armies, yet it was a war all the same. On one side, the forces of capital. On the other, the forces of labor. This was the §YGreat Class War§!, raging since the dawn of time. \n\nFollowing a recent string of victories for capital, the §7Republican§! candidate §YWilliam McKinley§! ascended to the presidency on March 4th, 1897, and would serve as president until the completion of his second term on March 4th, 1905. His administration was a typical one; he furthered American Imperialism abroad, and furthered the interests of the upper class at home. The position of capital was secure.\n\nYet there was one who would stand against them. The §RSocialist Party of America§! would speak for the worker, who had no voice of his own."
 USA_country_intro_desc_2:0 "The Winner-Take-All electoral system of the §3United States§! has long meant that two parties dominate the country's politics, from the local level up to the national. Once a party has secured the presidency even once, their electoral fortunes are assured for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor the better part of a century, the §3Democratic§! and §7Republican§! parties used this fact to their advantage. Both were capitalist in flavor; although the specifics varied by date and party, it was known that neither would ever become friendly to socialists in their ranks, making at best meaningless concessions to the working class.\n\nIt was long assumed that the system's strength lay in its rigidity; the fact that a party must win the presidency to be taken seriously on the national level would forever protect them from meaningful competition.\n\nWhat they failed to count on was the growing anger of the American people."
 USA_country_intro_desc_3:0 "The 1912 election changed everything. In an instant, a deadly blow was struck against the forces of capital, and §YEugene Victor Debs§! was elected the 29th president of the §3United States§!.\n\nBut the battle was not over yet. The forces of labor would have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of political ground ahead of them."

 USA_country_intro_desc_5:0 "But the good feelings would not last. In the spring of 1930, the system collapsed. Stocks fell, breadlines formed, and the coutry went to hell. Unfortunately for the country the man in the White House was §YHerbert Clark Hoover§!.\n\nA man who couldn’t bear to watch suffering, his reaction was one of denial. On December 2nd, 1930 the President informed Congress that "the fundamental strength of the economy is unimpaired." In 1932, when he was finally convinced to act, he created the Resconstruction Finance Corporation, which promptly loaned out 90 million dollars to banks, and and only 30 million dollars to states for relief.\n\nThe people of America were well aware of the President's apathy, and even the staunchest conservative recognized that he needed to go. The 1932 election saw the triumphant return of the §RSocialist Party§! to the halls of power, in the person of §YNorman Thomas§!."
