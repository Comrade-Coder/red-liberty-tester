 worldnews_ww2.1.title_starts_war:0 "The Second Great War"
 worldnews_ww2.1.desc_starts_war:0 "Any with the power of mild foresight could have recognized that following the Great War, no side left the negotiation table with any satisfaction towards what was gained or lost. The French Republic of the day was distraught at their failure to reclaim the region of Alsace-Lorraine, long considered a core part of the natural borders of France. It comes as little surprise to many that war has broken out over the region; following an ultimatum presented to the Reich government that was quickly denied, French forces began mobilization and quickly sent out a declaration of hostilities. Whether or not this war will end quickly, with cooler heads prevailing, or if we will be stuck in the trenches, another generation thrown into the mud to be lost forever, is largely unknown."

 worldnews.1.title:0 "President Thomas Re-elected!"
 worldnews.1.desc:0 "To the delight of some, the horror of others, and the surprise of many, Norman Thomas, the incumbent Socialist Party candidate, has won the 1936 election and is due to be sworn in on March 4th. Having defeated the upstart populist Lindbergh, the conservative Lister, and the liberal Roosevelt, it is now clear that socialism, at least as practiced by the Socialist Party of America, is now the dominate force in American politics. The Thomas administration still faces many challenges, but it's clear that they have the public's full confidence behind them."
 worldnews.1.a:0 "Send our Congratulations to our American Comrades!"
 worldnews.1.b:0 "Interesting."

 worldnews.2.title:0 "Lister Defeats Thomas!"
 worldnews.2.desc:0 "In an unexpected upset, the United States of America, long thought to have lurched irretrievably to the left, has now come back to the right, electing staunch conservative Lister Hill to the presidency. Hill's administration has promised both to protect "White interests" by opposing racial integration while also investing in public works, although not the the extent of his socialist and liberal opponents. Whether this combination will secure him a second term remains to be seen."
 worldnews.2.a:0 "Interesting."
 
 worldnews.3.title:0 "Electoral Deadlock in the United States!"
 worldnews.3.desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events, none of the three major candidates for U.S. President were able to reach the required threshold of 290 electoral votes to become president. The Socialist Party, failing to capitalize on their succeses of the past four years, lost several key states to the Democrats, who in turn lost several core states across the south to Lindbergh's upstart populist movement. The victor must now be decided by a special session of the House of Representatives, with each state delegation recieving one vote. With no party holding a complete majority of states, it seems likely that political intrigue will decide who will occupy the White House for the next four years."

 worldnews.6.title:0 "Lindbergh Wins in American Upset!"
 worldnews.6.desc:0 "In a shocking turn of events, Charles Lindbergh, famous aviator-turned-politician, has won the presidency! After a highly contentious election in which no candidate was able to secure the necessary electoral votes to win outright, Lindbergh's America First Party appears to have cut some kind of deal with the Democratic Party, who have put their support behind him, at least for now. Running on a decidedly populist platform, he has beaten out the conservative Lister, and the socialist Thomas, who had until now been considered by many to be a shoe-in. Promising an administration that will focus on the needs of the common man and woman, Lindbergh's upset has left many asking themsleves what other suprises he may have up his sleeve."

 worldnews.7.title:0 "Insurrection in the States!"
 worldnews.7.desc:0 "Reports have come in from the United States today about an apparent ongoing insurrection. Originally started in Pennsylvania, under the command of one William Dudley Pelley and his Silver Legion organization, he has begun cooperating with other right wing extremist groups across the nation. The Army has been working long and hard to tackle this guerrilla rebellion, with support from civilians and other nations. Some nations such as Italy have praised the insurrection for not only weakening the United States, but promoting a more friendly ideology that they can agree with. Millions are hoping that this does not lead to a second civil war."

In a speech to his supporters on the capitol, President Thomas has stated that an unprecedented mandate requires unprecedented action, and he is prepared to take such action, announcing his 'Second Bill of Rights' program. This legislative package is nothing if not ambitious, and would enshrine several major economic rights into law, if it can indeed get past Congress."

This shocking incident unfolded during a congressional session yesterday, leading to tragic losses of life. The Mexican Gold Shirts, known for their extreme nationalist views, have thrust themselves into the national spotlight with this audacious attack on the very heart of Mexican democracy. \n\nAmidst the chaos, President Calles, visibly disturbed, addressed the nation in a press conference, vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice and reaffirming the nation's commitment to its democratic principles."

 worldnews_war.1.title:0 "Turmoil in Brazil"
 worldnews_war.1.desc:0 "In the previous year, Brazil had been thrown into a political disaster. The Vargas Regime, opposing a new constitution promoting social reform, had been facing armed opposition by the National Liberation Alliance, a mostly communist political group, also consisting of social democrats, Catholics, and anarchists. The uprising had first started in Rio de Janeiro before spreading across several different cities, though mostly in poorer regions of Brazil. Vargas would declare civil war as his soldiers marched on their way to end this rebellion, while Prestes, leader of the NLA, would call for uprisings against the government. It is unknown who the victor of this bloody conflict would be, but it will determine the political balance in the Americas for the next few years."

Viva la Virgen de Guadalupe" have become deafening to Mexican authorities.
