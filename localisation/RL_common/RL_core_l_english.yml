 BREAD_AND_ROSES_NAME:0 "Bread and Roses"
 BREAD_AND_ROSES_DESC:0 "The World was paralyzed following the results of the First World War, tens of millions of young men have died for what seemed to be little to no gain in Europe or abroad. Socialist thought, once deemed degenerate and deranged is now commonplace and one of the world´s largest powers stands firmly under the Presidency of Norman Thomas, leader of the Socialist Party of America. The world is a far different place than the one dreamed about at the beginning of the century - will you aid the revolution of the common man, achieving equality for all? Or will you strike it down in the name of individual freedom and finance, striving for a world of the renewed American Dream?"
 USA_BREAD_AND_ROSES_DESC:0 "Thanks to the shrewd policies of the former President Debs, not only did America manage to stay out of the mess that was the Great War, but it also was the mediator of the resulting peace. Now, despite those efforts, the fraying concert of Europe threatens to disturb the burgeoning republic once again. The coming storm may be one that the country cannot avoid. Though the wounds of the depression are still fresh, many Americans feel that the worst is behind them. They revere Norman Thomas, the 'modern day Debs', and his socialist party. Only time will tell if their loyalty to the president is deserved."
