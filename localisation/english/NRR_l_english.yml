 NRR_starving_army_desc:0 "It is of little surprise to most that the North Russian Republic is incapable of properly supplying the military it attempts to maintain. Without the recognition or support of a Major Power, it is likely our dream of restoring Russia to its natural state will fail without a single shot fired. With a series of proper reforms and outside support, we will rise to the challenge."
 NRR_one_common_enemy:0 "One Common Enemy"
 NRR_one_common_enemy_desc:0 "The North Russian Republic is an unrecognised state localised in the region of Murmansk; born out of the remnants of expeditionary forces and Russian Whites who were trapped in the North, unable to reach the territories of Kolchak. The Republic stands with one singular goal; to eliminate the Communist Threat and restore the true Russian Government… whatever that may be!"
 NRR_northern_isolation:0 "Northern Isolation"
 NRR_northern_isolation_desc:0 "Our Republic and our people are isolated entirely from the rest of the world in almost every way that matters. We are unrecognised, and our ports, though developed to decent standards during The Great War are underutilised and often remain stagnant throughout the entire year. It is a lonely life we live, but it is for the glory of True Russia."
