 insurrectionary_anarchism_subtype_desc:0 "Anarchism is a political philosophy which advocates the abolition of all unjust hierarchy, as well as the destruction of oppressive structures such as governments, capitalism, and bigotry. Insurrectionary Anarchism differs from other strains of anarchist thought because it puts these principles into direct action, not via policy or reform but by immediate, violent revolt against all authority. Insurrectionary Anarchists will rarely ever negotiate with state authorities, and tend towards deliberately chaotic and militaristic."

 authoritarian_socialism_subtype:0 "Vanguard Socialism"
 authoritarian_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Whilst Marx's material contributions to the worldwide socialist movement have been fundamental to shaping socialist thought in the 20th century, the vagueness with regards to the ways in which to establish such a system required further ideological channeling, leading to the idea that a firm hand is not only ideal, but of a necessity, in order to promulgate and affirm the people's state, with a vanguard party, viewing the inherent contradictions in which people vote against their class interests, leading the charge instead of relying on broad popular support. In the eyes of these autocratic socialists, they wear this bandana with pride, seeing that only they, given the indoctrination of the masses, can upset the status quo, and viewing blind acts of vandalism and or revolution as anti-dialectical, requiring strict planning and coordination through the use of mass politics and democratic centralist organisations."

 revolutionary_autocracy_subtype_desc:0 "§YRevolutionary Autocracy§! is an interpretation of Marxist theory which views the Dictatorship of the Proletariat as a license to create an extremely authoritarian and repressive state. Usually ruled by a political vanguard party by means of secret police, military force, and purges, Revolutionary Autocracies are extremely centralized both politically and economically, often ruled by a single leader, and use Marxist thought as the justification for their rule. They often tend toward social conservatism, and no democracy is practiced within such states."

 revolutionary_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "Seeking to gather and mobilize broad support of the masses, and to tear down the status quo through revolutionary fervour, these radical socialists, first stemming from the ideas of the Narodniks in Russia and further formulated through Pyotr Tkachev, view the necessity of mob violence and or a combination of mass popular support from the oppressed worker and peasant classes as a prerequisite to achieving their aims. Although having a rather violent outlook on ways in which to establish their form of governance, revolutionary socialists are rather flexible when it comes to the way in which to govern such a state post revolution, with even some democratic socialist doctrines, such as council communists, who argue for a lenient body to govern once the state apparatus has been seized, but all share to common view that in order to get to that point, violence, coordinated or uncoordinated, is a necessary first step for such a task."
 
 proletarian_dictatorship_subtype:0 "Proletarian Dictatorship"
 proletarian_dictatorship_subtype_desc:0 "Favored by most Orthodox Marxists, Communists, and Leninists, the §YProletarian Dictatorship§! is a form of government ruled by a vanguard party, which is educated on the doctrines of Marxism and Communism, and leads with a high degree of political and economic centralization, often with a high degree of central planning. Proletarian Dictatorships usually include a restricted form of democracy, such as party membership-based voting, democratic centralism, or limits on acceptable speech."

As a co-founder of the Industrial Workers of the World, he is regarded as the forefather of revolutionary industrial unionism, his ideas having influence in not just the United States, but across much of the British Empire as well. While sharing some characteristics of anarcho-syndicalism, De Leonism actually differs from it in that De Leonism, and its proponents, still believe in the necessity of a political party advocating a Constitutional amendment making the Union the government of industry."
 
 scientific_socialism_subtype:0 "Scientific Socialism"
 scientific_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "While socialism itself is primarily based off of the principles of democracy and bottom-up social organization, scientific socialism adds a belief in, and in extreme cases a downright reverence for science into the mix. Scientific socialism seeks to create a logical, rational society of well-educated, free-thinking proletarians, who all work together for scientific progress. In practice, this takes the form of a sort of socialist technocracy in which the most capable and scientifically literate rise to positions of prominence."

When compared to standard socialist movements which are generally urban, industrial, and progressive, many agrarian socialist movements have tended to be rural, locally focused, and traditional.

Rejecting calls for revolution of any kind based on their belief that they lack the public support to fully overthrow capitalism, Sewer Socialists prefer to make gains where they can, passing laws to make workers' lives better in material ways, such as setting minimum wages, enforcing safe working conditions, regulating working hours, and using local governments to provide amenities like running water, electricity, and sewer systems to working class areas. Radicals often scoff that Sewer Socialists aren't doing enough to overthrow capitalism, but their short-term benefits for the welfare of the working class are hard to ignore."

They believe that Islam has to distance itself from the 'qadim'- the old and traditionalist methods and embrace new ways to catch up with the rest of the world.

Liberal conservatism incorporates the classical-liberal view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference. However, liberal conservatism also holds that individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life; therefore, liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation."

The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A military citizenship arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.

True socialism according to Spengler would take the form of a corporatism, in which local corporate bodies organized according to the importance of each occupation to the people as a whole; higher representation in stages up to a supreme council of the state; there would be no organized parties, no professional politicians, no periodic elections.\n\nSpenger strongly opposed labor strikes, trade unions, progressive taxation or any imposition of taxes on the rich, any shortening of the working day, as well as any form of government insurance for sickness, old age, accidents, or unemployment.
