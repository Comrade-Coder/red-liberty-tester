 SER_national_humiliation_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia has faced total and utter defeat at the hands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and its allies during the Great War. Having been totally occupied for five years, all hope for resistance and most national pride have largely been erased regardless of the newfound freedom following the war. Serbia is humiliated and is unlikely to pull back from such a horrible situation."
