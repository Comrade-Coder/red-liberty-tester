 demo_ww2.2.desc:0 "Any with the power of mild foresight could have recognized that following the Great War, no side left the negotiation table with any satisfaction towards what was gained or lost. The French Republic of the day was distraught at their failure to reclaim the region of Alsace-Lorraine, long considered a core part of the natural borders of France. It comes as little surprise to many that war has broken out over the region; following an ultimatum presented to the Reich government that was quickly denied, French forces began mobilization and quickly sent out a declaration of hostilities. Whether or not this war will end quickly, with cooler heads prevailing, or if we will be stuck in the trenches, another generation thrown into the mud to be lost forever, is largely unknown."

Although there are no reports of conflict arising between Belgian and French forces as they cross the border, almost entirely due to the lack of any military preparedness on the side of Belgium, it is expected the Brussels Government will either join the French in their campaign or soon begin a campaign of resistance, much like they conducted in 1914."

 demo_ahe.1.title:0 "The Vienna Uprising"
 demo_ahe.1.desc:0 "Since the end of the First World War, Austria’s Empire has been in a consistent state of decline. With economic and social turmoil being repeatedly mismanaged by Austria’s centrist government, leftist dissension in the nation and its dominions has grown increasingly more volatile throughout the 1930s. Though the formation of a National Unity Government briefly provided hope that the nation would recover, the lack of any tangible growth or recovery has quickly radicalized Austria’s left wing even moreso than before.\n\nIn response to the Imperial Tax Edict of 1936, which promised major tax hikes on the working class, tensions have only grown larger. This culminated in a major labor strike in Vienna beginning on September 12, which quickly turned riotous as workers and other socialist sympathizers began a march toward the Imperial Council. Their efforts would be praised by socialist leader Karl Renner, as well as Hungarian socialist Mátyás Rákosi, further emboldening the rioters.\n\nImperial garrisons and police around Vienna quickly found themselves overwhelmed, stepping down to avoid an engagement which they were confident they would not win. As such, there was effectively no defense to prevent the rioters from accessing the Imperial Council, or even the Royal Family. In response, Karl I, his family, and several other prominent politicians (including Vienna’s mayor) have been smuggled out of Vienna in the dead of night and transferred westward to Innsbruck, where their primary support base remains.\n\nAs such, the rioters now have effective control of Austria’s largest city and capital. Other towns and cities in eastern Austria have declared their support for the strikers, and regional militias have already risen up and forced more Imperial assets westward.\n\nNow the whole world waits with bated breath as Austria’s system seems as though it might finally collapse in on itself."

Meanwhile, Karl Renner, leader of the Socialists; has taken immediately to calling upon Socialist Militias and ordering the round-up of all ideological enemies... it is a frightening time in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. Is civil war inevitable or will cooler heads prevail?"

 demo_ahe.3.title:0 "The September Constitution"
 demo_ahe.3.desc:0 "Following the seizure of Vienna by socialist rioters on September 19th, there has been a great upheaval in Austria’s governance and status quo. Many have lost their faith in the current system after the Imperial Family’s flight westward, and in an instant, it seemed that the only valid authority in Austria was the Vienna Uprising. In fact, it wouldn’t be long before the rioters invited Karl Renner, leader of the Socialists, to take over. Renner, along with his allies in the German Workers’ Front (as well as several splitters from the Social Democratic Workers’ Party) immediately took to drafting a new instrument of government, as they viewed the Revolution as being their mandate to rule.\n\nAs such, Renner and his allies have drafted the ‘September 26 Constitution,’ a new governing document for the nation. In practice, it adopts many of the same principles and ideas as Austria’s old Constitution, albeit with a few meaningful changes. Firstly, the Royal Family and Imperial Council have had their powers revoked, as a new Workers’ Congress has been established to rule over the nation. Additionally, the Constitution has ended the Austrian system of Dualism, and in fact stated that the government no longer claims responsibility for the former dominions of the empire.\n\nThis declaration has been met with much confusion, as politicians in Czechia, Croatia, Hungary, and beyond find themselves in an apparent power vacuum. That said, local authorities around the empire’s former eastern territories have already begun scrambling to pull together a government, as those few assets still loyal to Vienna either flee or are imprisoned. The remnant moderate forces in Innsbruck have also begun to arm themselves, declaring the Constitution illegitimate and stating an intent to reclaim Vienna and crush the revolution.\n\nIn any case, it indeed seems that overnight Austria-Hungary has collapsed, and in its wake, a wave of new revolutions and conflicts will soon rock the continent."

This Republic is to be constituted of the Austrian territories of the former Dual Monarchies whilst no longer claiming responsibility for the Empire's former dominions such as Bohemia or Hungary. These vague terms have left many regions in an odd state of limbo. Meanwhile, the government of Emperor Karl I declared this new constitution to be illegal - troops within the west have begun mobilisation and militias will be called to strike down the Vienna Government.\n\nFighting is yet to break out, as both sides wait to see who will crack first."

A new fear hangs in the air that this new regime may refuse to abide by promises of elections and fair appointments, turning into yet another Bonapartist regime with the newfound power placed in the office of the President.

 demo.Ger_Rus_war_declaration.1.d:0 "Unsuspectedly, or rather, admirably, what was seen as an empire overstretched to their limit has decided to go on the offense, responding to repeated calls by the wehrmacht to act first against Russian provocation, the German armada has crossed the boundaries established in Brest-Litovsky, catching the Russian bear off their balance. Although a bold move by the German ruling class, it is to be seen whether the people of Germany and other empires who watch this conflict will take the opportunity in the case of German blemishes on the battlefield to enforce their own agendas, for an Eagle with a crippled wing can not remain in the air for long."

 demo.Second_Great_War.d:0 "At last, the predicted judgement day, predicted by the militant speeches of François de la Rocque  and his euphorically passionate base of French crowds that gathered at the Bastille on the news of the declaration of war against the Prussian Eagle, the flails of liberalism that seemed to have kept nationalism at bay for the period following the first major European conflict in a centurian has finally given way to unequivocal irredentism.\n\nIn respone to the French dispos calls for their unlikely ally in the Isles to intervene, the UK parliament has also voiced their intentions to join on the side of France in the conflict against the predisposed European juggernaut that lay in Berlin, even with the seemingly close dynastic ties of these two nations, it would appear that the obligation of the English to restore the European balance of power in their favour would have to be met before they would ever consider to rescind into self inflicted isolation from the continent.\n\nWhat appears to be lacking on both sides of the conflict is enthusiasm from the workers of these nations, as the strong anti-war movement that had grown following the great conflict of the 20th century that developed inspired by the socialist movement in the North American Basin has disollusioned many industrial working class families to come out of support for their government's decision to respond to the prospects of more blood being shed.\n\nAlas, whilst many may not die for their heads of state, they will for sure follow the calls of their forefathers to lay their arms in the plains of Picardy and beyond if it ensures their national existence."

Largely suspected, however denying involvement, the Anatolian government has remained silent, although hinting that any further clamping down on protestors, which seems to be an eventuality at this point, will lead to "severe retaliation"."
