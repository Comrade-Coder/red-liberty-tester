 demo_ww2.2.desc:0 "Any with the power of mild foresight could have recognized that following the Great War, no side left the negotiation table with any satisfaction towards what was gained or lost. The French Republic of the day was distraught at their failure to reclaim the region of Alsace-Lorraine, long considered a core part of the natural borders of France on the frontier with the Germans. It comes as little surprise to many that war has broken out over the region, following an ultimatum presented to the Reich government that was quickly denied, French Forces began mobilization and quickly sent out a declaration of hostilities. Whether or not this war will end quickly, with cooler heads prevailing, or if we will be stuck in the trenches, another generation thrown into the mud to be lost forever, is largely unknown."

Although there are no reports of conflict arising between Belgian and French forces as they cross the border, almost entirely due to the lack of any military preparedness on the side of Belgium, it is expected the Brussels Government will either join the French in their campaign or soon begin a campaign of resistance, much like they conducted in 1914."

 demo_ger.2.desc:0 "As Kaiser Wilhelm left the Reichstag this morning shots rang out from the entrance of the building, a radical member of the SPD fired six rounds of .455 Webley into the chest and abdomen of the Kaiser. It’s reported the elderly monarch died immediately upon the assault, with the ensuing chaos in the streets of the surrounding area only solidifying what was already bound to happen. In a split second, the man who had held the reigns of the Reich since 1888 had been snuffed out by an angry Socialist, angered with the deaths of millions of workers in what he considered to be an unjustified and Imperialistic war of the bourgeoisie.\n\nIn an emergency session held in the Reichstag, members of the Diet, with the notable exception of any Socialist or Communist individuals, unanimously decreed the reinstatement of the Sozialistengesetz, a series of acts restricting and otherwise banning parties or politics supporting or endorsing Social Democracy, Socialism or Communism. It is expected the Deutschnationale Volkspartei and its leader, Alfred Hugenburg will only continue to gain popular support with this attack against the very heart of Germany being perpetrated by leftist forces. As to how the Diet will move forward from this point forward, past banning their opposition - many fear the Government has already gone too far, some worry that there is an internal conspiracy still at play to destroy the Reich, spearheaded by Judeo-Bolshevik forces from America and Russia."

 demo_ahe.1.title:0 "The Vienna Uprising"
 demo_ahe.1.desc:0 "Since the end of the First World War, Austria’s Empire has been in a consistent state of decline. With economic and social turmoil being repeatedly mismanaged by Austria’s centrist government, leftist dissension in the nation and its dominions has grown increasingly more volatile throughout the 1930s. Though the formation of a National Unity Government briefly provided hope that the nation would recover, the lack of any tangible growth or recovery has quickly radicalized Austria’s left wing even moreso than before.\n\nIn response to the Imperial Tax Edict of 1936, which promised major tax hikes on the working class, tensions have only grown larger. This culminated in a major labor strike in Vienna beginning on September 12, which quickly turned riotous as workers and other socialist sympathizers began a march toward the Imperial Council. Their efforts would be praised by socialist leader Karl Renner, as well as Hungarian socialist Mátyás Rákosi, further emboldening the rioters.\n\nImperial garrisons and police around Vienna quickly found themselves overwhelmed, stepping down to avoid an engagement which they were confident they would not win. As such, there was effectively no defense to prevent the rioters from accessing the Imperial Council, or even the Royal Family. In response, Karl I, his family, and several other prominent politicians (including Vienna’s mayor) have been smuggled out of Vienna in the dead of night and transferred westward to Innsbruck, where their primary support base remains.\n\nAs such, the rioters now have effective control of Austria’s largest city and capital. Other towns and cities in eastern Austria have declared their support for the strikers, and regional militias have already risen up and forced more Imperial assets westward.\n\nNow the whole world waits with bated breath as Austria’s system seems as though it might finally collapse in on itself."

 demo_ahe.3.desc:0 "Following the seizure of Vienna by socialist rioters on September 19th, there has been a great upheaval in Austria’s governance and status quo. Many have lost their faith in the current system after the Imperial Family’s flight westward, and in an instant, it seemed that the only valid authority in Austria was the Vienna Uprising. In fact, it wouldn’t be long before the rioters invited Karl Renner, leader of the Socialists, to take over. Renner, along with his allies in the German Workers’ Front (as well as several splitters from the Social Democratic Workers’ Party) immediately took to drafting a new instrument of government, as they viewed the Revolution as being their mandate to rule.\n\nAs such, Renner and his allies have drafted the ‘September 26 Constitution,’ a new governing document for the nation. In practice, it adopts many of the same principles and ideas as Austria’s old Constitution, albeit with a few meaningful changes. Firstly, the Royal Family and Imperial Council have had their powers revoked, as a new Workers’ Congress has been established to rule over the nation. Additionally, the Constitution has ended the Austrian system of Dualism, and in fact stated that the government no longer claims responsibility for the former dominions of the empire.\n\nThis declaration has been met with much confusion, as politicians in Czechia, Croatia, Hungary, and beyond find themselves in an apparent power vacuum. That said, local authorities around the empire’s former eastern territories have already begun scrambling to pull together a government, as those few assets still loyal to Vienna either flee or are imprisoned. The remnant moderate forces in Innsbruck have also begun to arm themselves, declaring the Constitution illegitimate and stating an intent to reclaim Vienna and crush the revolution.\n\nIn any case, it indeed seems that overnight Austria-Hungary has collapsed, and in its wake, a wave of new revolutions and conflicts will soon rock the continent."

A new fear hangs in the air that this new regime may refuse to abide by promises of elections and fair appointments, turning into yet another Bonapartist regime with the newfound power placed in the office of the President.

 demo.Finnish_Intervention_In_Russian_Civil_War.3.d:0 "In a surprise turn of events for what many predicted to be a for gone conclusion in the Finnish-Soviet war, the Soviet government has sent foreign minister [get name of minister] to sign a truce in Murmansk with the now acclaimed strategist Mannerheim to disclose the peace treaty that would not only cease hostilities in the advantage of the Finns, but also conceede the territorial integrity of Soviet bases in the Kola Peninsula.\n\n in towns and the few cities that Finns can proudly claim to, jubilant crowds have chanted the name of their saviour and of the rejuvenating blish that has fallen over this seemingly destined borderland between the now defunct Swedish and Russian imperial powers, now able to set it's own destiny in the region, with the whites in the East humbly congrajulating the Finns in their successes against the Bolshevik menace, even if future revanchist claims may fall onto these lands once the whites reestablish themselves, for now the Finns may celebrate their hard earned victory."

 demo_bosphorus_uprising.1.desc:0 "With the increased hostilities between the Anatolian government and the international commission, holding the bridge that separates Asia from Europe, the local garrisons had been given orders to crack down on the ensuing and expected protests that'd follow the break down of talks that would lead to the reintegration of the territory into the Anatolian apparatus, what was not expected, however, was the sheer brutality in which these protests were suppressed.In response to increased hostilities, an uprising by the masses of the largely thought to be subdued Sürgün people's of the city state has overwhelmed the security forces, with the Hagia Sophia being barricaded by both imams and reverends, unsatisfied with the deterioration of order within the anarchic fallout. Largely suspected, however denying involvement, the Anatolian government has remained silent, although hinting that any further clamping down on protestors, which seems to be an eventuality at this point, will lead to "severe retaliation"."
