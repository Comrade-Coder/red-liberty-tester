 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KOLCHAK_DESC:0 "Known to his people as Supreme Leader of All Russias and Defender of the Russian State, Alexander Kolchak is the stern and melancholic steward of the rightful Romanov claim, facts disputed only by the Bolsheviks and their allies. Born the son of a major-general in St. Petersburg, Kolchak pursued a career in the navy from his youth, graduating from the Naval Cadet Corps at twenty years of age. He spent much of his early career in the Far East, and occasionally undertook exploratory expeditions to the North Pole, earning the nickname ‘Kolchak the Polar’ for his efforts in the Arctic and his eternally bleak disposition. In the following years, Kolchak became a noted figure of the Imperial Russian Navy, taking part in the reconstruction of the Russian Fleet following the humiliation of the Empire in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, and becoming commander of the Black Sea Fleet during the Great War. It was during the Russian Civil War (which some would say is still on-going), however, that Kolchak truly distinguished himself.\n\nThough initially reluctant to take power, Alexander Kolchak was voted Supreme Leader of All Russias by the remaining cabinet of the Provisional Government in 1918, with the Great War still raging in the background and the forces of White Russia facing the very real threat of capitulation. In the wake of Kolchak’s rise to power and the establishment of what is now the Russian State, his government became quickly known for the brutal suppression and execution of Bolshevik partisans and supporters, and the unrelenting campaign against Bolshevism which saw the eventual consolidation of the Russian State East of the Ural Mountains. Although open conflict has largely ceased, spies and constant skirmishes across the border ensure that eternal vigilance is upheld. Kolchak is growing older now, but has left in his wake an impressive tale of resistance to the forces of Bolshevism and of unity in the defence of country."

 RUS_eternal_transition:0 "Eternal Transition"
 RUS_eternal_transition_desc:0 "Created from the remnants of the Russian Republic in the aftermath of Lenin's revolution, the Russian State was always meant to be a transitional government; merely a tool to be used to crush the young Bolshevik revolution before either the Tsar or the Republic was restored. But plans never survive first contact, and the same is true of the Russian State.\n\nNow, a decade later, it is as though the civil war never ended, and at any day commanders on the front lines will once again order their men forward against the red menace, to reclaim the honour and glory of holy Russia."
 RUS_alone_in_the_cold:0 "Alone in the Cold"
 RUS_alone_in_the_cold_desc:0 "As the civil war dragged on, the resources at Supreme Leader Kolchak's disposal dwindled and vanished, slipping through his fingers like sand. Abandoned by the entente, betrayed by the rebellious Cossacks, and unable to truly rouse the people of Siberia to his cause, Kolchak's sole saving grace has been that the Bolsheviks are in just as poor a position as he is. At least, they were."
 RUS_crippling_debt:0 "Crippling Debt"
 RUS_crippling_debt_desc:0 "For decades the Russian State has devoted itself to military strength and order, in an effort to defend against the Bolshevik hordes in the West, and against Red saboteurs within. A consequence of this is that White Russia has a rather weak and underdeveloped civilian economy, being forced to rely upon massive loans from foreign entities, most notably their former allies in the UK and former enemies in Japan. The only saving grace thus far is that no one expects the State to actually be able to pay them back in the near future. But should the situation change..."
 RUS_new_years_strike:0 "The New Years Strike"
 RUS_new_years_strike_desc:0 "Beginning in the dreary final days of December and quickly spreading across the country from Omsk to Vladivostok, the New Years Strike has consumed the industry of Russia. Protesting long hours, low pay and perilous conditions, industrial workers have taken to the streets in some of the Russian State’s largest cities."
