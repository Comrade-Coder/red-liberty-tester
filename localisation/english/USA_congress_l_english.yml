When he'd gotten older, he'd gone down into the mines himself.\n\nAnd, as had many other West Virginian coal miners, he'd gotten caught up in the whirlwind of political radicalism. His brother had been at Blair Mountain, and he himself was a proud redneck; a socialist organizer and unionizer. He'd voted for Norman Thomas in '32, and intended to do so again in this year's elections.\n\nWhat he was really excited for today was the social security bill. It would be a godsend to folks like him, who did hard labor for a living. They needed the money when they retired; the hard, unforgiving work often left their bodies broken, and he knew too many people who relied on charity and church donations to survive in their old age. A monthly payment would be a godsend.\n\nHe searched through the paper's pages, feeling more and more dejected until, finally, he found what he was looking for: a small article on the next to last page about the voting on the bill. It... it had succeeded!\n\nA wave of relief washed over Harold, and he leaned back in his chair, casting his eyes up at the ceiling as a grin spread across his face. “Thank you, Lord!” He leaned back forward to continue reading the short article, which was mostly about what the social security bill would do. He felt immensely grateful; to God, to Norman Thomas, and of course to the Socialist Party. Now he wouldn't feel pain in his heart when he saw those old men in church, bent double in ragged clothes, unable to support themselves.\n\nA new day was slowly dawning, and it seemed bright."

"That's what we call surplus-value Billy, and you're being robbed without you even knowing it!" said the local socialist farmer friend in the area, radicalized by the socialist party's agenda.

"The ayes for passage are 54 to 46 nays, with the Senate confirming the house's decision to enact equitable parity between farmers and their tenants, and to compensate malpractices of tenants onto the farmers, and to pay a sum that would be considered a livable wage."\n\nWhat followed was a flurry of ecstatic mumbo jumbo to most, but for the family, was their way of celebrating their newly found rights and privileges, topping that night off with the family's favourite dish, Billy slept soundly together with his family, kissing them all goodnight, as he dozed off, he felt a smile creep over his face, feeling for once that all the blood and soil he put into this small farm of his would now be so much more."
