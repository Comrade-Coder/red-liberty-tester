 URG_two_worlds:0 "A Nation Between Two Worlds"
 URG_two_worlds_desc:0 "The nation of Uruguay has largely owed its existence to the diplomatic considerations of it's two bigger neighbours of Argentina and Brazil who, after briefly conquering the territories following Spanish influence waning, was forced to relinquish the territories after the 33 orientales waged a 3 year long guerilla campaign to liberate the country. Our nation has thus largely been dependent on these two powers on our doorsteps and their political considerations, with the two dominant political factions, the Colorado party and the Blancos, both being headed by Brazilian and Argentine interests and allegiances respectively, leading some to question whether or not Uruguay, in the case of either turning to revanchist or grander territorial ambitions, would fall into the position of a David, this time against two Goliaths."
