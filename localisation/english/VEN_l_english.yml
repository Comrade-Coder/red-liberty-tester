 VEN_big_three_desc:0 "Venezuela is a land filled with natural resources, with Caracas brimming with oil off the shores and coasts of this great and prosperous nation. However, due to the discovery of such reserves, foreign interest groups, especially British and Rockefeller funded liasons have had a triopoly consolidate and wither down the 100 companies that had originally sent drilling missions to the lakeof Maracaibo; Shell, Gulf, and Creole Oil. If we are to dare challenge this status quo gain economic independence, we will for sure be risking our political security, which is why this blatant robbing of our nation's resources has continued for so long."
