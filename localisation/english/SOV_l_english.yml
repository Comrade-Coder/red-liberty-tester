 SOV_nikolai_bukharin:0 "Nikolai Bukharin"
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_BUKHARIN_DESC:0 "Born in 1888, Nikolai Ivanovich Bukharin has dedicated the majority of his life to the Bolshevik cause. As a student, he took part in demonstrations at Moscow University during the 1905 revolution, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1906. He was internally exiled in Russia for his political activities before escaping to Germany and then the United States. After the 1917 revolution he returned to Russia and began working under Lenin, being promoted to General Secretary to replace Stalin shortly before Lenin's death, based on Lenin's fears that the current state of instability would be ideal conditions for Stalin to seize absolute power.\n\nSince then and until the present, Bukharin has worked hard to govern as Lenin would have, with a few of his own ideological touches. He has reinforced the New Economic Policy and is proud to have brought swathes of the Soviet People out of poverty and into a modern, socialist society. He has kept the NKVD on a tight leash, preferring to let the people think freely and express themselves through state-approved media. But now that most immediate issues have been solved, unrest is once again growing in the Party, and Bukharin is ill-equipped to deal with it. His centrist stint as General Secretary has left him with many enemies and few friends, and he knows that his days in power are limited. The only question that remains is who he will favor to succeed him."

 SOV_home_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Russia is the first nation in the world to have her workers rise up and overthrow the oppressor classes, and we are rightfully proud of it! From Petrograd to the Volga, the workers are free! However, the task remains only half finished. Our brethren in the east still suffer under the iron heel of their reactionary-bourgeois oppressors, and the world has yet to fully embrace socialism. Forward, comrades, to victory and freedom!"
 SOV_political_turmoil:0 "Political Turmoil"
 SOV_political_turmoil_desc:0 "The Russian Communist Party is in utter turmoil! While Lenin’s theories of Democratic Centralism and practice of stocking the party’s ranks with men and women of different opinions may have worked in theory, it certainly does not work in practice. While factions are officially banned, certain party members reliably vote together on almost every issue. This has gradually let to an almost total gridlock at all levels of government as the different factions vie for dominance. From the Congress of Soviets to the Politburo itself, what started as simple ideological disputes have quickly grown into heated arguments, personal insults, and in a few cases, even fistfights and pistol-brandishing. This cannot continue forever, and tensions will inevitably come to a head in the near future..."
 SOV_nep:0 "The New Economic Policy"
 SOV_nep_desc:0 "Formulated by Lenin before the Civil War had even concluded and put into effect shortly afterwards, the New Economic Policy, or NEP, is the successor economic system to War Communism, which was practiced by Soviet Russia during the Russian Civil War. Under the NEP, the state has relinquished control of some small and medium-sized industries to private and co-operative control, while keeping a firm grasp on major industries and the financial sector. With a few hiccups, such as Scissors Crisis, the NEP has largely succeeded, with agriculture and then industry recovering from the carnage of the civil war. However, the NEP was always meant to be a temporary measure, and now that the economy has recovered and war seems to be on the horizon, many new economic theories are being proposed, and the NEP is left with few supporters in the government aside from the General Secretary himself."
 SOV_tsarist_captives:0 "Tsarist Captives"
 SOV_tsarist_captives_desc:0 "Ever since the trial and execution of Nicholas II in 1923, the remainder of the Imperial Family have been captives in the Summer Palace of Peter the Great in Petrograd. Too dangerous to let free, but having committed no crime that would warrant execution, they exist in a state of limbo, in perpetual fear for their future. Alexei Nikolaevich is now the heir apparent to the crown of Russia, following the murder of of his uncle, Grand Duke Micheal, and the execution of his father, although he has understandably made no mention of his opinions on this to the foreign journalists who are permitted to see the family."
