 USA_cristiada_desc:0 "§YLa Cristiada§!\n\nThe situation in Mexico has devolved into open violence. Catholic antipathy towards the secular constitution of Mexico established in 1917 has been slowly building for years, and it has been previously suggested by the Department of War that the situation would eventually spill over in into open violence, which it now has.\n\nLarge sections of central Mexico have rebelled, under the leadership of Enrique Gorostieta, who the Department regretfully cannot readily find information about, but it would be safe to assume that he desires the presidency of Mexico and to re-write the Mexican constitution to make Catholicism the state religion.\n\nThe central government is currently being led by Plutarco Elías Calles, leader of the Labourist Party, which the current administration will favor, as they are mostly socialists and unionists, serving as the political arm of the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers, currently the most powerful worker's union in Mexico."
