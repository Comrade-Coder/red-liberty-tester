 CRI_shipyard_state_desc:0 "The Crimean Peninsula has been occupied by the German Empire since the end of the Eastern Front of the First World War, perpetually unsure of its own status and autonomy. The Colony now stands firmly under direct German supervision with the locals tossed to the sidelines politically... and yet the colonial government remains immensely popular as the job market always has openings and room to work your way up to the High Offices in Lubeck and Hamburg. With the entire nation focused entirely on Naval Production, it remains an immensely important project of the Kaiser, only time will tell how the upcoming turbulence will affect the industry."
