 USA_norman_thomas:0 "Norman Thomas"
 the_last_idealist:0 "The Last Idealist"
 POLITICS_NORMAN_THOMAS_DESC:0 "A Princeton graduate and Presbyterian minister, Norman Thomas made his first impression in politics with his pacifist, anti-war activism during the Great War, a position that drew him to the Socialist Party of America, who had delivered on their promises to keep America out of it. He gained popularity as an SPA journalist and was elected governor of New York in 1924. When Eugene V. Debs died in 1926, Thomas became the new head of the party as its leading non-immigrant member. He lost his first bid for president to Herbert Hoover in 1928, but after the Stock Market crash in 1929, Hoover’s popularity plummeted, and in 1932 President Norman Thomas and the SPA won the Presidency in a landslide. For all of his term, Norman Thomas has set about fixing the Great Depression with large amounts of government spending, public works projects, bureaucratic expansion, and worker-led recovery efforts. His recovery policies have been hindered and watered down by political resistance from the center and right wing, but where they have been enacted, have been both successful and popular."

 USA_james_maurer:0 "James Hudson Maurer"
 POLITICS_JAMES_MAURER_DESC:0 "James Hudson Maurer is perhaps one of the most remarkable men in the socialist party, being the epitomy of a rags to riches story. Born into a poor Pennsylvanian family of German emigres, the young James started working in a factory at age of 10, having to support the family once his father died of smallpox. This experience would almost immediately begin to shape his political views, as he established connections with the Knights of Labor, a populist labor organisation, where he would bury his head deep in books on the economy and the plights of the working class.\n\nAfter a brief split within the socialist camp beginning in the 20th century over the role of the unions, James would promptly take the union side of the argument, successfully running as a working class champion for the house in the subsequent 1910, 12, and 14 elections, before briefly losing the elections of 16', still, this remarkable streak of victories would catch the eye of leading socialist Norman Thomas at the time, earning him the position of Speaker of the House.\n\nHaving climbed to such great heights, there is only one question left in the minds of both his admirers and his enemies: will he be the next in line after Thomas, or remain content in his position as an ardent knight of labor?"

 USA_jack_reed:0 "John Silas Reed"
 POLITICS_JACK_REED_DESC:0 "John Silas Reed, simply known as "Jack" to his comrades, is not what you would typically expect from a hard-core socialist. Born a child of privilege, in his grandparents' mansion to a business-oriented family from Portland, Oregon, from a young age Reed was the rather rebellious type. Ultimately culminating in a falling out with both his parents and the potential connections with business magnates, who viewed his writings for various newspapers such as the American Magazine as irrevocably heinous, causing a great deal of mental stress on the young pioneer in his youth.\n\nNonetheless, Reed has established a reputation as an adventurous and flamboyant character, willing to put himself into dangerous situations for a story. After arriving in New York, his career in journalism would quickly take off through his coverage of the Paterson Strike, which no other reporter at the time would dare lay on their portfolio. He traveled to Mexico during the Mexican Civil War, and relayed the bloody carnage of the European theatre during the Great War, as well as the Russian front, being one of the few pacifist reporters to report on the war in such vivid, yet uncompromising detail. His book, "100 Days That Shook the World", a recollection of the first 100 days of the Debs presidency, has become quite possibly one of the most famous pieces of literature of the early 20th century.\n\nNow, after many years of involvement in the SPA, here he stands, as Vice President. His brand of socialism is closely linked to Bukharin's, having become acquainted during his adventures in the Russian Civil War, with him even going so far as to establish a Bukharinist wing within the party. A controversial man, his actions and writings have made him many friends, but many more enemies, making him the definitive picture of an idealistic, yet courageous man in a sea of political tepidness."

 USA_city_on_a_hill_desc:0 "To be the great nation that many have aspired for, in what seemed to be only fallible in the confines of human imagination, the America that we the people have built, has required blood, sweat, and tears. This is self evident through the patriotism of the millions of Americans who, no matter where they've been born, or their political affiliations, have one common allegiance: to strive for a better America for Tomorrow.\n\nThis has meant building institutions that work by, and for the people, even if this has meant trying and testing programmes along with various other institutional and economic reforms in order to strengthen this ideal. But nothing in nation building is ever easy, for, as Matthew's Gospel puts it best; "Ye are the light of the world, for a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid".\n\nIf God commands that our country and her people must strive to keep to this ideal, the ideal of being a shining beacon upon the world, venerated and feared for it's prowess, we must stay vigilant in tackling American issues; not European, Asian, or even South American issues, but the issues that keep this very nation from striving for the greatness that our forefathers grasped for."

Starting in the mid-20's, falling prices made it more difficult for farmers to turn a profit on their produce. The arrival of the depression only served to make conditions even worse, as monetary contraction meant that consumers suddenly had less to spend, reducing profits even further. Overnight, it became more worthwhile to burn grain for heat than to try to sell it on the market.\n\nSince then the situation has, thankfully, improved. With government efforts to drive up prices and provide relief to thos in need, the worst days of the crisis are behind us."
