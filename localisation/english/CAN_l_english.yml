 POLITICS_MACKENZIE_KING_DESC:0 "Distant. Cold. Uncharismatic. A mystic. An out of touch intellectual. A man with precious few friends. All of these describe William Lyon Mackenzie King. And despite it all, he is the Prime Minster of Canada.\n\nBorn in 1874, King's enigmatic politics would start early and last his entire life. A Presbyterian since his younger years, he became interested in social welfare and political reform, yet never showed interest in becoming a socialist. When he desired a teaching position, he fomented a strike among university students, showing political aptitude early in his life. He was first elected to the Canadian Parliament in 1908 as a member of the Liberal Party, and in 1909 was entrusted with the newly created post of Minister of Labour, where he oversaw reforms that benefited millions of working Canadians.\n\nHe has since been in and out of parliamentary power, traveling around North America to serve in various posts in government and in various colleges and universities. His opposition to conscription during the Great War made him widely popular among Canadians, and despite his many personal defects he continues to posses a sharp political mind.\n\nAs a life-long liberal, King has no interest in socialism, but instead prefers liberal corporatism, which he hopes will quash radicalism while serving to promote public welfare and social unity. Only time will tell if his methods will bear fruit."
 
 CAN_favoured_son:0 "Favoured Son of the Empire"
 CAN_favoured_son_desc:0 "The British Empire is supposedly an entity which sees multiple states and their imperial possessions united within it. The United Kingdom is obviously the head of this great imperial family, however, the aftermath of the Great War has left London weak both economically and militarily. London now turns to its dominions for support; more so to Canada then the others. Canada is unlike the other Dominions within the Empire; Canada is the prince of the Empire.\n\nCanadian forces in the war didn’t fail their operations, paving the way for many Canadian officers being welcomed into the Imperial Staff in London. Canada’s proximity to the Home Isles compared to the other Dominions has seen the Canadian economy boom, with new flourishing industries such as the motor industry. Britain’s reliance on Canadian exports to fill the gap in the home market alongside Canadians becoming more present in the planning of Imperial operations has seen Canada become the de facto heir to the Empire. This new international prestige has given Canada new standing within the British Commonwealth, granting him more sway on the Imperial stage, but also suspicion from traditionalists in London and other dominions who wish to replace the oldest son as Britain’s favourite son."
 CAN_booming_economy:0 "Booming Economy"
 CAN_booming_economy_desc:0 "Canada after the Great War was much like Britain after the Great War. Her economy chugged along till 1929 when the depression hit America. Trade with America had always been high and the sudden drop in demand alongside the passing of the Smooth-Hawley tariff brough Canada’s economy to a screeching halt. A lack of demand from their biggest trading partner saw the oldest son of the Empire struggle. However the 1931 Sterling crash changed the fate of the Canadian economy.\n\nThe 1931 Pound Sterling crash in Britain saw many British businesses close due to economic hardships. The lack of supply in Britain coinciding with a large demand in England forced Britain to turn to her Empire for economic relief, and who else could Britain turn to but Canada. Nowadays, the Canadian economy has been booming for the last five years, with Canada exporting large quantities of new goods such as cars to Britain and the other dominions. Canada stands at the peak of economic success, but everyone knows; good things don’t last forever."
 CAN_quebec_divide:0 "The Quebec Divide"
 CAN_quebec_divide_desc:0 "Canada fought alongside her mother nation in the Great War in the name of the Empire. The battles of Ypres, the Somme, and Passchendaele saw many of our young men die on the fields of France and Flanders. However, Canada could and would not falter in front of her brother dominions. Therefore in 1917, the government enacted a conscription act to send more men to the frontlines. The loyal sons of the Empire answered the call to arms in the name of loyalty to the Crown, however many French Canadians refused the call to arms.\n\nThey argued that the war which Canada was fighting was one of Anglo imperialism. Why should a son of Quebec die for Anglo interests, while the Anglo yoke oppressed them at home, was the battle cry of many French Canadians. The initial riots were ultimately dispersed by military police, which luckily occurred alongside the end of the war in 1919. However, the Quebecois have not forgotten this ‘transgression’ against their people. Quebec nationalism is still being stoked nearly a decade and a half later by men such as Premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis, who now beats the war drums of Quebecois independence. These acts of nationalism must be stopped before they escalate, which could threaten Canada’s newfound standing within the Commonwealth, and maybe even the concept of a united Canada itself."
