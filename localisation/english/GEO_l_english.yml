 georgia.1.desc:0 "Shocking news has come out of the capital city Tbilisi today of a bombing on the German embassy. The anti German sentiment in Georgia is not a new thing, and an every growing group in Georgia has been demanding the exit from the German lead Warschaur Pakt, and the end of as they say it "boot licking the Germans". This sentiment has largly sprung from the fact that German owned comapanies own the majority of Georgia's recources as a part of an agrement between the Georgian and German governments. This has not only led to a decrease in access to much needed recources in Georgia, but an ever declining wealth of the populas. The growing anti German sentiment has only recently formented its self in the way of the "Free Georgian League or FGL", a political party and militia fighting for an end to German influence in Georgia. But still it was largly peacful unrest until the shocking news came out the a FGL member had detonated a bomb in the German embassy killing 7 including the German ambasador. This act of terroism which was quickly claimed by the FGL has led to protests in the street and a growing militantism among the Georgian people."

Soon after the attack on Gori troops moved into the FGL controlled cities of Mleta, Telavi, Tsnori, and Anaklia with little resistance, and with the tide clearly on our side a final push to the ever growing FGL army amassed outside Mtskheta was commenced. Quickly becoming the bloodiest battle of the rather short uprising with over 4,000 dead the FGL army fell after nearly two days of hard fought fighting and quickly afterwards FGL cells across the nation surrendered seeing their revolution falling to peices, with the rest fleeing to the country side."

With this coalition quickly growing a decision was made, and soon they took a strike right at the heart of the Democratic Republic, and stormed the building of governance, before taking the members of the national council at gunpoint and forcing them to give power to the military. With the coup being successful the new government took no time in beginning their new campaign to defeat the FGL which could be refered to only as a terror. Within mere weeks a secret police force was established, and violent repression of anyone suspected of suporting either the FGL or the old Democratic Republic began.

The trade unions formed a collective demand of, the 8 hour day, the creation of an institution to moniter and enforce safe working conditions, a minimum wage, and social security for retirement.

Although many have agreed to the Free Republic, esspessically with their victory against the Germans, their policies have been less agreed upon. On one side stands those opposed to their liberal ideas and concessions with the unionists, while on the other side they want more concessions to the unions and more power to the workers in this new government. And to stop conflict, secure the state, and allow for new reforms the government has agreeded to remake the 1918 Georgian constitution which had many falicies in it. And while this reform is widely supported as the old constitution had German aligence written into it, the spesifics are much more debated. And among the largest group of these are the trade unions who demand more power to the workers in the constitution, and so to stop any worries [Root.GetLeader] gave an adress in Tbilisi about this new constitution.\n \n"My fellow country men, I stand here today in pride, for soon our great nation will be reborn again free of German tyranny, and free for all people of Georiga. And to do this we must rewrite the constitution, but fear not my friends, for this will be done with great care, and great consideration-". And in the middle of [Root.GetLeader]'s speach a loud roar went up among the crowd demanding concessions to the unions in the constitution. [Root.GetLeader] continued with the rest of the speech, but upon returning to his chambers the crowd could be heard outside demanding power to the unions. Should we cave into this and give power to the unions in the constitution it will quell the crowds, but would lead to considerable power in the hands of the unions, and the socialists, but to not include these concessions in the constitution could lead to the alienation of much of the Georigan population."
