 NZL_civil_unrest:0 "Economic Protests"
 NZL_civil_unrest_desc:0 "As a direct result of the Great Depression, New Zealand's economy curve has been going down and down. Many people have been left jobless, investements have decreased significantly and men could be seen sleeping on the streets. The poor handling of the situation by the government has given rise to mass unrest and protests which have significantly reduced the government's authority over the people. We must deal with the situation quickly, before the situation spirals out of control."
 NZL_disunited_government:0 "Disunited Government"
 NZL_disunited_government_desc:0 "The current government headed by the Labour Party of New Zealand is plagued by internal factionalism. The state of administration has degenerated to such a state, where petty squabbles for even the smallest things turn into heated arguments and debates which can go on for hours. The major factions of the Labour are the Hardliners and Moderates. If we allow these rampant arguments to continue, we may eventually see an irrecuperable split of the party."
 NZL_maori_rights:0 "Māori Rights Movement"
 NZL_maori_rights_desc:0 "The Maori are the indigenous people of Aotearoa, who had first originated from Eastern Polynesia. With the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, Western and Maori cultures lived peacefully for a generation. However, with the dawn of the 1860s came large land confiscations, which provoked Maori unrest. In 1877, the Waitangi Treaty was officially nullified and the natives were forcefully assimilated into the western culture. The effects of the nullfication of this treaty could still be felt to this day, and now with the aftermath of the Great Depression, the Indigenous people have begun to plea for equal rights. Whether this effort by the Maori population bear fruit or not, is uncertain for now."
