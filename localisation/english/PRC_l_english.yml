 POLITICS_REN_BISHI_DESC:0 "Initially landing in a distant third place in the Communist Party of China's leadership struggle, Ren Bishi was a darkhorse candidate for the position of General Secretary. But after the untimely deaths of Mao Zedong and Chen Duxiu, Ren has ascended to the leadership.\n\nBorn in 1904, Ren was raised in a teacher's family, and pursued further education for most of his early life. While attending university in 1920 he joined the youth wing of the Communist Party of China, going on to visit Moscow and attend the Communist University of the Toilers of the East until 1924, at which time he returned to China. Since then, he has been instrumental in a number of party actions and has continued to work as a devoted communist, and now he has finally ascended to the position of General Secretary."
 
 PRC_mass_migration:0 "Mass Migration"
 PRC_mass_migration_desc:0 "Since the beginning of our socialist experiment, we have relied upon migrants, those forced to serve after setting foot on the island. Although we stand in exile on the island of Hainan, our armed forces are almost entirely composed of migrants and refugees from the mainland or elsewhere. They seek freedom from the tyrannical chaos that has engulfed our homeland, and until we reclaim the lion’s share of the mainland, this will have to be the indefinite state of affairs. If we were to stop migration, we would be lucky if we had a tenth of our manpower. While this may lead to foreign infiltration, that is a small sacrifice we are willing to make. The locals simply detest mass migration, but it is necessary for the creation of a New China."
 PRC_protracted_revolution:0 "Protracted Revolution"
 PRC_protracted_revolution_desc:0 "For more than twenty years the people of China have been in a state of revolution. Since the first uprisings in Harbin and Shanghai, we have relentlessly and wholeheartedly fought to defend all proletarians! Sadly, this revolution has been more arduous and painful than anyone could predict. With our exile to Hainan, we have been extremely, albeit temporarily, set back.\n\nCurrently, the scars of our relentless revolution are beginning to show: the standard of living in our republic has been lacking. With a total focus upon the war effort, we have forgotten the needs of the proletariat. We could give every man in our nation a gun and ammunition yet the vast majority of them will go hungry. Almost all civilian manufacturing has been shut down to continue the war effort. After all of this suffering and sacrifice, what do we have to show for it? A small island and tens of thousands dead. Morale has never been lower. Until we address the issues we are faced with, the revolution can never be truly stable. Decisive action must be taken, lest the future for an egalitarian world be quelled."
 PRC_the_new_culture:0 "The New Culture"
 PRC_the_new_culture_desc:0 "To ensure that the immortal science of Marxism-Leninism is upheld, a new proletarian culture has been shaped, built around three pillars: Collectivism, Nationalism, and Vanguardism.\n\nThe first pillar, collectivism. For a socialist nation to thrive there must be a collective spirit in all facets of life. You must put the needs of your community above your own. The virtues of generosity and charity are the base of proletarian culture.\n\nThe second pillar, Nationalism, is total devotion to your nation; being willing to die for your nation is the bare minimum. You can and will do everything to forward your nation even if it means you are worse off. Even if you are hungry you will give the oil from your food to make machinery. You will be willing to protect this nation even if you have small children. You will be willing to report all actions of friends or family that may show disloyalty to the nation. You are a part of this nation. Every citizen is key in ensuring the protection and harmony of the republic. Your sacrifice will bring joy to others in the nation. To work is to be glorious and to work hard for your nation even more so.\n\nThe third pillar is total acceptance of the vanguard and the leader. The vanguard has fought for China’s freedom relentlessly. The vanguard is the body to advance the nation. The leader and vanguard are unwavering in serving the people. The works of key politburo members are taught at all levels in schooling. Revolutionary martyrs who died fighting for the people’s revolution like Mao Zedong and Chen Duxiu are upheld as saint-like figures. Discipline is needed for any functioning society and acceptance of benevolent authority is key. These pillars are the foundations of the society of the future and only socialism can lead you down the path to a great proletarian society. A society built upon egalitarianism, true liberty,  hard work, and love for all men. As long as the three pillars of proletarian are upheld the path towards a more perfect society will relentlessly march on."
 PRC_total_siege:0 "Total Siege"
 PRC_total_siege_desc:0 " Since the great evacuations of Yangjiang and Maoming, we have had our revolution-in-exile on the island of Hainan. Beset on all sides by foreign invaders, an unrecognized state in a constant state of siege, we can rely only upon ourselves for protection. With our extremely limited resources, we have built a surprisingly robust defence, which has protected us from large-scale invasion for now.\n\nThe issue is that this situation simply is not sustainable. Agriculture here is near impossible, the staple food is rice, and wheat cannot be cultivated. The number of coconuts and pineapples we can grow cannot feed a country half of our size. Famine has become a constant in our republic. The siege has destroyed our economy, a total embargo crippling our ability to procure equipment and resources. It has forced us to dedicate nearly all of our economy to the war effort, making some basics like paper and candles being nearly unobtainable. This has led to a massive black market that siphons off millions from government coffers. We cannot continue to exist like this, we must break the siege. Over the past few months, we have trained our troops for an eventual, glorious return to the mainland. Our soldiers yearn to return to the mainland, to be reunited with their families. If we held even a small amount of land on the mainland, it would not only be a massive boost to morale, it would be a springboard to finally reunite China. The light of socialist freedom will illuminate China."

Ren Bishi order's walks in his headquarters and tells his radio operators to send the word 'Firefly' in which is a code word for the southern revolution to ignite. the embers of the CPC have lighted the proletarian revolution! \n\n In the next hour Ren Bishi makes a public announcement, set to broadcast throughout China. He says... \n\n Tongzhimen(Comrade)! We have fired a shot, we have lit the fire! \n\n Our revolution shall now neter a new stage as we launch an uprising against the capitalist traitors of the warlord cliques.
