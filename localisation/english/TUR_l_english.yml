 TUR_federation:0 "A Federation of Equals"
 TUR_federation_desc:0 "With the introduction of the Tanzimat Reforms in 1839, the wheels of progress began to turn. Albeit slowly, we have begun the process of emancipating the ethnic minorities of the former empire. With the brilliant statesman and former Grand Vizier Ali Sabhaddin and Ahment Riza, their combined efforts led to the unification of the various millets of the empire under the Hamayouni Decree of 1925 and the Ten Conditions of Ahmet Riza, both increasingly aiming for the unification of the federation in the name of Anatolianism. Although still in its infancy, the federation now gathers its strength, and perhaps in time, the peoples of this great nation will come to regard themselves as Anatolians above all else."
 TUR_unequal_treaties:0 "The Unequal Treaties"
 TUR_unequal_treaties_desc:0 "The collapse of the empire was in large part due to Talaat Pasha's miscalculation in the Great War. We had no friends or allies to speak of, and now, the fact that the caliphate is still alive is a miracle in and of itself.\n\nIt has come at the cost of our national pride however, as under the treaties of Sevres and Sivas, signed after the war, we have relinquised our imperial past. This has not sat well with our citizens, with defeatism and radicalism still widespread amongst the families who lost their husbands and sons, in the holy lands and beyond."

If we were to in any case deviate from our westernised and civilised path however, this support may swiftly be reconsidered, causing untold havic on our industrial base."
 TUR_growing_opposition:0 "Growing Ulema Opposition"
 TUR_growing_opposition_desc:0 "With the government's radical shift in approach to the attitudes to the people of the former imperial dominion, the conservative elements in society have voiced their concerns of "autonomy" and the right to practice and profess islam in state and public gatherings, and have smeared our efforts of unifying the religions and cultures of the Anatolian people's as " laicité  suffocation", mocking the so called French influence in our state.\n\nIf we are to push through reforms with regards to unifying education and our religious institutions, we can safely expect our Imams to call for jihad against the perceived unholy policies."
 TUR_karakol_society:0 "The Karakol Society"
 TUR_karakol_society_desc:0 "Following the disintegration of the empire, and the failed national revolution, Enver Pasha and his acquaintances retreated into the shadows; with their tempting promises of "avenging the backstabbing by the greco-armenian lobbyist dogs through a national jihad", these radicals hold a degree of sway in our government, whether we believe it or not.\n\n§rContinuing to turn a blind eye to this issue may have... unforseen consequences, should the political climate be at a knife's edge.§!"

 ### Characters ###
 TUR_adnan_adivar:0 "Adnan Adivar"
 POLITICS_ADNAN_ADIVAR_DESC:0 "After navigating through the relatively turbulent political climate following Ahmet Riza’s death, Adnan Adivar stands tall amongst both his rivals and his allies in the assembly, but more than his superb negotiating skills, medical, and military expertise, the polymath’s origins are even more bewildering to say the least.\n\nBorn in Gelibolu in what is now in the administrative zone of the Straits Commission, Adnan was born into a family brimming with knowledge and intellect, going on to excel in the School of Medicine, moving to Berlin for a time to assist with Austrian renowned Friedrich Kraus, getting inspired by the work in electrocardiography.\n\nReturning to Turkey as a chief medical doctor, he participated in the battle of Derna as chief medical inspector, which gave him a glimpse into the cruelties of war, joining the army soon after whilst also marrying his beloved Halide Edip, who some would consider to have been “overshadowing” him.\n\nNonetheless, with the collapse of the Ottoman fronts, Adivar positioned himself as a fierce opponent to imperial concessions to the Entente, however being a savior officer himself, he had to accept the overwhelming consensus to attempt to salvage the image of the empire and topple the CUP dominated triumvirate, leading him in posts in both medical and military cabinet positions in the successive governments.\n\nNow having politically maneuvered all other opponents within the party, Adivar in his short time in office has already accomplished much and promised even more; the reintegration of the Straits Commission into the Anatolian heartland, representing the people of Konstantinye, reforming the healthcare system, and for the first time meeting yearly debt repayments to the Entente since they had begun. He has signaled, however, his transformative reforms to be implemented in education, schooling and the military will be a necessary step to “bring Anatolia to be not merely an asset, but a definitive beacon of the prosperous western world at large”, only time will tell if these promises are simply hot air, or the rebirth of a nation and her people."
 
 TUR_kazim_karabekir:0 "Kazim Karabekir"
 POLITICS_KAZIM_KARABEKIR_DESC:0 "A man of many titles, who can't by any doubt be regarded as being one of the most instrumental military figures following the collapse of the empire, having abandoned his foremost ally Kemal Pasha to his early grave after seeing the continuous failures of the government at the time, has become a venerated figure in Anatolia, but this, as proven by his upbringing, was not a given.\n\n Having been born to a family with roots in the tatars of central asia, having settled in Rumelia as part of the land grant given to many tatars for defending against greek rebellions in the 17th and 18th centuries, with an education in the capital of the empire, before finishing his primary education in Mecca, furthering his education with Istanbul Fatih Military High School and Kuleli Military High School. This wouldn't prove however how much of a fighter on the battlefield he'd be, showing his capabilities by suppressing the 1910 Albanian revolt, and leading alongside with Kemal Pasha in the balkan campaigns against the belligerent Balkan nations, proving his ability at defending strategic objectives at the battle of Edirne. \n\n this and his connections to the Mustafa Kemal earned him his promotion to field marshal, securing numerous victories against combined French and British forces in both Syria and Baghdad, being one of the few strategists to pursue a policy of resistance against allied invasions within the scorching deserts of the arabian peninsular field. \n\n Alas the work of one man could not stop the bitter fall of the empire, with the humiliating decision to be present at the signing of the Sivas declaration, after betraying his former man-in-arms for the sake of securing a future for the newly established federation, which he would accomplish, advising the government on further actions of centralising authority and renegotiating, albeit incremently, terms of the treaty, and his attempts to modernise the army have been, with the exception of Adnan and his weariness of Kazim's growing clique, a large success. \n\n now at the helms of a beleaguered yet proud nation, he now seeks to bring it into a new age of modernity through an autarkic form of governance and policy making, aiming to nationalize and centralise the administration in order to be self sufficient, which has not been received favourably amongst foreign press, and even within his own party coalition, he must step a fine line in order to not provoke his rivals, lest he risks to doom the nation to dogmatists and idealogues that would place their own interests over their own nations' future."
 
 TUR_riza_tevfik:0 "Riza Tevfik"
 POLITICS_RIZA_TEVFIK_DESC:0 "It would be foolish to discuss or debate on turkish literature and the education system that is still in the progress of change and reform, without having Riza Tevfik in the room, having been one of the founding fathers of modern turkish literature, as well as one of the founders of the first scientific journal in the former Ottoman Empire, his revolutionary writings are to be reveered as much as his revolutionary ideals. \n\n born in the county of Cisr in the former province of Edirne, the young Riza was by many metrics destined for greatness in some form; his father having been one of the district governors of the region, graduating from the prestigious Gellibolu Secondary School with flying colors, moving on to complete a doctorate in medicine, before changing course to focus his aims on literature and the sciences, which were still severly lacking in the now sick man of Europe, which would put him into contact with the CUP, before becoming disallusioned with it himself, viewing the Freedom and Entente Party better representing his more liberal views, albeit still deviating from many of his colleagues politically.\n\nFollowing the post war humiliation, he would be one of the members present to sign the treaty of Sivas, which would be a damp patch on his reputation, especially amongst his students, though he would aim to rectify it by first becoming a bureacrat in the medical scene, whilst secretly getting into touch with the now revolutionary current of Kadro literary members, such as Şevket Süreyya Aydemir, who would greatly reinforce his left leaning views and more revolutionary ideas within parliament, forming his own grouping that would represent social democratic ideals espoused within nations such as the UK and the US.\n\nNow at the head of the Anatolian Federation, Riza's ambitions are vast, ranging from reforming the medical sectors to provide affordable and efficient treatment, to raising the working class as the center piece of the Federation, and building a poletarian culture, albeit in the frame work of a market economy, these will all be difficult to achieve, given not only opposition within the coalition, but also his allies in the Kadro circle, seeking to sideline him and use Riza as a tool to fulfill their more Bolshevik agenda, the now aged Tevfik must thread a fine line in order to satisfy all parties, for a sound revolution requires a sound mind to achieve.

 TUR_fethi_okyar:0 "Fethi Okyar"
 POLITICS_FETHI_OKYAR_DESC:0 "Seen by many as merely as the handpicked successor to Adnan following his downfall, Fethi Okyar is much more than meets the eye, having served as a military liason, and as one of the utmost diplomats to the United Kingdom in his tenure, he has been the darling of much of the established intelligenstia within the party, who view him as both experienced and well positioned in not only unifying the party, but the nation as a whole. \n\n His central aim is to continue the path of his predecessors, of both delegating responsibility for the crimes of the Young Turks, and to modernise and liberalise the economy of the federation, although unlike Adnan, who pursued a policy of government oversight that some within the party called socialistic in nature, Okyar is by no means willing to step on the tails of the minority groups and interests within the vast federation, which to some may be a hinderance to governing and truly modernising the destitute feudal lives of these groups especially in the near east, whilst others would find this to be respecting the wishes and the wills of the federation's peoples, which Adnan had nearly risked at provoking. \n\n With a coalition that has struggled to find its identity having been in power for so long, Okyar is also in favour of working with the opposition, officially to bridge the divide amongst the more conservative and critical voices in the country, whilst speculatively it is in order to solidify a conservative block that would superceede the necessity of the coalition, in light of continued attempts at chipping away at it's more moderate core towards degenerate statist policies, but time shall tell whether these concerns are mere slander, or deadly accurate."

 anatolia_straits_events.1.desc:0 "With the guidance and direction of the Grand Vizier, the famed and well liked Mehmet Akif Ersoy was sent with one mission in mind; to obtain the recognition of the Entente powers of Anatolia's rightful claim to the region, and to start renegotiating the terms of Sivas in order to achieve this.\n\n as the morning breeze settled in the Vizier's office, he noticed a telegraph message relayed within his office, with the word in bold "önemli" as the title head, with it relaying to the Vizier the allied powers, especially France, who Mehmet is known to be well versed in dealing, being open to the idea to renegoiate terms, on the conditions of further opening of the market towards French and English entrepenurial businesses, and further commitments to remain a democratic block in the area, in return for conceeding Anatolia the right to remilitarize and secure it's territorial boundaries over the Bosphorous channel.\n\n Although the Vizier was in no ways meaning not to further commercial ties with the powers that have laid the foundations of the federation following the collapse of the stilted and bygone empire of old, he did have to take into account the coalition's many nationalist circles, who deem furthering political concessions to the British and French as defacing the people's of the federation to market forces, insisting to even work with the Germans whom had been the principle enemy of the nation during the Great War. \n\n Whatever may be the decision of the Vizier matters not, for the die must be cast, whether with his consent or without it, for the political legitimacy of the coalition rested upon reclaiming the straits as a symbol of national pride."

 anatolia.1.title:0 "From the Ashes of an Empire"
 anatolia.1.desc:0 "The Federation of Anatolian States, colloquially known as the Anatolian Federation, was able to claw its way out of annihilation which imperial powers sought to impose upon it, rejuvinating under the doctrine of  Anatolianism, a modern evolution of Ottomanism, aiming to reconcile with the bloody past of the collapsing Ottoman Empire. This was in large part thanks to the circumstances of the post war years, and the clever calculations of Grand Vizier Dermid Pasha, as the Entente powers, failing in their European campaigns, were convinced in keeping a loyal pawn that would deter Bolshevik and Hunnic aggression in the Near East.\n\nHaving to come to terms with it's brutal past, admitting the faults of the vicious and savagery of the dogmatic CUP militants who carried out untold oppression amongst populations under the Kemalist-led "Three Pashas Triumvirate", the empire that had been for centuries been a flawed, yet beautifully tolerant nation, was cast into the darkest abyss in it's history, with untold lives and generations lost under their leadership.\n\nThe main political force of this new state is the Liberal Özgürlük Partisi (LOP), taking in both dissaffected dissidents who had cut their ties with the disgraced CUP, and former HIF members, guiding the country alongside with the now largely figurehead Caliphate for the following years under the steadfast leadership of both Sabhaddin Ali and Ahmet Riza, both critics of one another at one point who would resolve their differences to lead the new state into it's golden age, overseeing the rapid industrialization of previously neglected cities such as Ankara, Trabizon, and Sivas.\n\nHowever not all is well in the empire, as the bureaucratic backwardness of the previous Ottoman state still is largely intact, due to the hard headed opposition of the Ulusal Düzen Partisi (UDP), a big tent conservative-islamic alliance that seeks to keep the state a religiously islamic society, refusing attempts to modernise the heavily islamic system of education, which largely discriminates many non-muslims, especially in the medreses schools from which the islamic wing outright refuses to accept non-muslims into, whilst also advocating for more power in the hands of the Caliphate, and more moderate members of the party, idolising a more fair independent foreign policy that the LOP has pivoted country from, as well as a more top down approach to governance, although many are suspected to have connections to the menacing Karakol society.\n\nThe future of Anatolia seems bright, with the re-establishment of the state as a beacon of democracy in a sea of illiberalism in neighbouring regions, it remains to be seen whether Grand Vizier Adnan Adivar Bey will steer the country's course further towards the path of enlightenment and rid the nation of her defeatism, in order to create something truly beautiful out of the darkness of her demons."
