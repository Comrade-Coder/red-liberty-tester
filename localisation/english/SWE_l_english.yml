 SWE_scandinavian_steel_desc:0 "While most nations faced ruin or glory during the years of the Great War - the Kingdom of Sweden remained neutral throughout the entire ordeal, looking instead to profit off of their rich wealth of natural resources. Sweden is, within certain markets, the largest exporter of multiple natural resources that will be immensely important for Europe and the wars to come."
 SWE_statare:0 "Statare"
 SWE_statare_desc:0 "What started as a form of bondage in the 1800s, spreading from the state of Södermanland, and now present across much of southern and parts of central Sweden, the statare are a relic of feudal practices, whereby married laborers are paid in kind, rather than in Krone, for their services. Owning no land, nor having any right to the farms that they cultivate, the system has been derided by its critics as a form of contracted slavery.\n\nFacing ever increasing opposition from the SAP and from smaller agrarian parties, this antiquated and outdated system is in desperate need of reform, although many within the cabinet and aristocracy have much to lose from relieving these peasants from their bondage, due to many relying on these families for their exploited labour."
