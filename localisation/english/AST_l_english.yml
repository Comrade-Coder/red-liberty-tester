 AST_currency_devaluation:0 "Currency Devaluation"
 AST_currency_devaluation_desc:0 "With the current economic order in disarray, following the departure of the US from the gold standard, as well as the UK and various other nations unable to adhere to the standards of monetary fiscal spending, we have been forced to revalue our currency as a result of the impending and already impacting economic consequences of these interlinking issues, with our government pegging the Australian pound lower than market value in order to reduce our trade deficit, and make our goods cheaper.\n\nWhether these will be affective in combatting our economic woes in the longterm is highly contested by various political groupings, with some economists lambasting such actions as defimating our own international standing, and hurting current wages, as the value of our currency is pegged downwards, so too is purchasing power, with our successes depending on the course of action our government and subsequent administrations take."
 AST_rampant_unemployment:0 "Rampant Unemployment"
 AST_rampant_unemployment_desc:0 "Everywhere you look, there is a jumbuck on every corner of every neighbourhood of every city within the commonwealth, with whole families as a result of the depression stuck in virtual poverty, and this has started to eat at the coffers of the state, with less and less tax revenue to be generated, economic demand and stimulation have been sluggish at best, with people less willing to save up their savings as a result of market tribulations, compounded by the state having to provide services for citizens unable to find work, if nothing is done to combat this bastardising poverty, we may find ourselves with a whole generation of aussies without any prospect of work and or education."
 AST_white_australia_policy:0 "White Australia Policy"
 AST_white_australia_policy_desc:0 "One of the first acts of the newly fledged commonwealth of Australia under the liberal government of 1901, which would go down as a landmark act to all, although for rather infamous, or noble reasons, depending on whom you ask, was the immigration restriction act, commonly referred to as the "White Australia" policy, which barred any colored people's from entering the country, including but not limited to the Chinese, Japanese, South East Asians, and Kanaks, or pacific islanders.\n\nThis is in large part due to resentment from white collar and rural workers who, envying the cheap labour and the scare of costs of living decreasing as a result of an increasing influx of Chinese labour, culminated in violence on the Buckland River in Victoria in 1850, followed by successive attacks and deplorable imagery depicting Asiatics as "Pests", with the White Australia policy merely codifying this resentment into law, barring any non-Europeans who can't speak a European language, even meaning English speakers would be tested in French to drive any chance of colored peoples entering the country. This has been a controversial sticking point in Australian society, with both the left and business magnates deploring it, albeit for their own political reasonings, it has also made us a black spot of the pacific, with many Asian states resenting us for such blatant discriminatory policies directed towards them."
 AST_premiers_plan:0 "Premiers' Plan"
 AST_premiers_plan_desc:0 "Agreed by all states of the Federation, the Economic principles adopted and sponsored by the right wing of Labour under Joseph Lyons calls for balancing the budget and cutting down costs in order to reduce the compounded inflation plagueing Australian produce, which in turn, increased prices across the board. This has of course, not been without criticism, as it also cut state wages, and left pay rates to stagnate even with increasing inflation, with cuts to spending across the board, this has provoked many of the Labour party, particularly of the Lang faction, who see more merit to the Keynesian approach of construction spending and debt borrowing in order to stimulate economic growth.\n\nIf we are to be able to continue with our mandate and get out of this damning period of our country, we must reconcile with these contradictions within the Labour movement, and attempt to convince our electorates that our policies will bear fruit within the near future, if we want to keep the keys to parliament out from the radical left."
