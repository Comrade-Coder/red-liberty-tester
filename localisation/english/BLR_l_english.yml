 BLR_weak_national_identity_desc:0 "What does it mean to be a Belarusian? According to the people of Minsk, very little. This state has only gained its independence less than twenty years ago - and largely is incapable of forming a common notion of what exactly they are, or represent. Majority opinion rules towards the idea that Belarus and the people within it, are simply Russian separated from the Russian State - a final democratic remnant of what used to be the Motherland before it collapsed.\n\nWith all due luck, the current National Government may finally take the steps necessary to reform the nation into something unique; otherwise it may simply be time to embrace our Russian heritage."
