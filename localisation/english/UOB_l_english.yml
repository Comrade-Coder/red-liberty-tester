 UOB_civil_war_desc:0 "Our Civil War has raged now for over a year, and we are soon to gain the upper hand; support pours from abroad and our soldiers take key strategic positions by the day. Our side shall be victorious and it is only a matter of time before we are home with our families to celebrate the success of our one true, legitimate, government!"
 UOB_left_wing_coalition:0 "Left-Wing Coalition"
 UOB_left_wing_coalition_desc:0 "There are many points during a Civil War where unity is absolutely key, the dire situation faced by the Leftist Forces spread out inside the borders of what was once Brazil is absolutely one of them. Cut off from the Industrial heartland of the nation, plagued with poor leadership, equipment and scorn from their neighbours, it is unlikely this coalition will survive should any conflict be waged inside the ranks. But… for the most ambitious of leaders, this incredible instability and weak leadership may just be the perfect moment to establish themselves as the future leadership of Red Brazil."
