 POLITICS_OTTO_RUGE_DESC:0 "Lieutenant General Otto Ruge was the most important Norwegian officer in the first half of the 20th century. He had a great influence on the defense reforms in the 1920’s and showed an early understanding that the country's defense had to be designed so that it could be able to meet the new challenges of the time. His radical and unsentimental view of defense policy made him a highly controversial figure in conservative military and pro-defense circles in the 1930s. As Commanding General and leader from the 11th of April 1933 after a successful coup, Ruge gave himself the responsibility of leading the Norwegian forces. His actions during the overthrow of the Socialist coalition directly led to Norway's later right wing outlook and secured him a prominent place in the nation's history.\n\nRuge had a reputation as an inspiring and knowledgeable teacher with great pedagogical abilities. In addition to his interest in educational issues, he was throughout his career actively involved in military science, political and historical issues. Otto’s involvement in right wing and militarist groups made him grow to hate the Communist movement.\n\nHe spent many of his years before the coup plotting in secret with his most loyal militarists. The grand plan to root out the Socialist and Communist growth in Norway succeeded. Otto sees himself as the proper leader of Norway, and therefore purged many politicians that could have been a potential threat to his rule. The silenced politicians in Norway fear Otto will try to extend his belief further, and root out Socialism elsewhere as well."
 
 NOR_stor_terror:0 "Stor Terror"
 NOR_stor_terror_desc:0 "The Great Terror is a consolidated effort by the Supreme Leader Otto Ruge and his Government to eliminate any and all traces of Leftist Degeneracy within the Norwegian State. Children are indoctrinated in schools and encouraged to inform the police on Anti-Social behaviour exhibited by their parents - neighbours turn on neighbours and those who keep quiet about Degenerate friends or loved ones are considered just as guilty as the offenders. Degenerates are sent to re-education camps and will be permitted to return to civil society once deemed acceptable by local officials. Oddly enough, none have been permitted to return in the ten years the program has been active."
