 POLITICS_KARL_I_DESC:0 "Born in a castle in 1887, Karl I was a Hapsburg, and raised a devout Catholic. He was also raised so he could become a noble, and lived in Vienna for some time. He would join the army in 1906 and would study law and politics around the same time. He was not close with his uncle, Franz Ferdinand, but following his death, he became the heir of Austria-Hungary, and would become the Emperor in 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. Despite a cold that developed into pneumonia that nearly killed him, he has remained healthy since and currently remains the leader of Austria, but he is struggling with internal issues in his empire thanks to the ethnic groups and socialist riots in the streets. The flames of revolution are growing, and he must do his best to prevent a full blown revolution and the collapse of his country. God save the Emperor."

The flames of revolution have burst, and now he is fighting off socialist forces in his country as his empire collapsed. God save the Emperor."
 
 AHE_incompetent_military:0 "Incompetent Military"
 AHE_incompetent_military_desc:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire has struggled for decades with military preparedness, our tactics remain in the era of Napoleon rather than the modern day - worse even is our officer corps, in which oftentimes those with rank to hold charge, do not command men that can understand their language. Strict centralisation and reform must be enacted before we can call ourselves a military power once again."
 AHE_doomed_empire:0 "A Doomed Empire"
 AHE_doomed_empire_desc:0 "As is common in any large Empire, certain ethnic and racial groups within our Empire have grown increasingly radical over the last few decades, their demands for autonomy have rightly been ignored and the central Austrian Authority grows weaker each day... we'll require a miracle to save this Empire."
 AHE_german_dependence:0 "Dependence on German Finance"
 AHE_german_dependence_desc:0 "As Austria's economy collapsed post-war German firms took advantage and moved into Austria to expand their business. As such, commodity prices and general economic health are heavily contingent on German corporations rather than Austrian ones."
 AHE_inept_legislature:0 "Inept Legislature"
 AHE_inept_legislature_desc:0 "National Courts and Local Governments have long been stacked with friendly representatives of whomever had been in control at the time, leading to incredibly loyal and friendly governing bodies, and yet you'd be hard pressed to find any progress having been made in years. Purges and a focus on anti-corruption are all that can solve this mess of an issue."
 
 AHE_beacon_of_hope:0 "A Beacon of Hope"
 AHE_beacon_of_hope_desc:0 "For centuries, Austria's has been an Empire that oppressed its people and workers. With our rise, this ends now. Austria shall be a new nation of equals, no longer devastated by poor government policies."
