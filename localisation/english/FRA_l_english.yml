 FRA_fallen_govt_desc:0 "Until a complete restructure of the Government, or a total return of public trust in the democratic process can be restored there is little to no hope of any governing body taking full control anytime soon.

If not dealt with carefully, these leagues may very well just take hold of France and guide it in a very unsavoury direction."

 ### FRENCH COLONIES ###
 
 FRAC_loyal_to_paris:0 "Loyal to Paris"

 FRA_reassure_diplomats:0 "Reassuring our benefactors"
 FRA_reassure_diplomats_desc:0 "Given the tensions rising across Europe, and reports of local armed groups, including Bukharinist inspired Communes and Soviets forming up, we must demonstrate a show of force in order to make it seem as though everything is as it should be, after all, we are the masters here."
 FRA_reorg_colonial_army:0 "Reorganising the colonial army corps"
 FRA_reorg_colonial_army_desc:0 "The Armée coloniale has seen... better days. With lack of funds due to most money being spent trying to recuperate losses, the coloniale regiments have been loosely equipped. That changes today, with Advancements in logistical capabilities, we will push the limits of what it means to be a soldier of egalite"
 FRA_establish_national_departments:0 "Instating colonial insitutions"
 FRA_establish_national_departments_desc:0 "French pride in having a hand in continuous development of overseas departments has resulted in run on budgets. Following the example of Paul Doumer and his successes in turning Indochina profitable and a jewel of the East, we shall establish our own national departments, with french oversight of course."
 FRA_secure_contracts:0 "Securing financing from abroad"
 FRA_secure_contracts_desc:0 "Given our issues with maintaining our coffers, securing foreign contracts would do us wonders to finance our military and industrial renewal drive, easing the burden on Paris at the same time."
 FRA_learn_from_europe:0 "Learning from Europe"
 FRA_learn_from_europe_desc:0 "Given the rich history of our homeland, and the great impacts of warfare that have transpired and caused considerable pride and hardship to it, from these turbulencies we shall build ourselves to show that we won't let another Leipzig or Waterloo occur in our lifetime!"
 FRA_advancements_in_artillery:0 "Advancements in self propelled technology"
 FRA_advancements_in_artillery_desc:0 "If there is one thing that was learnt from the Napoleonic wars, the Franco Prussian war, and the great war is this; artillery is king. Our Howitzer 105mm artillery pieces have not been keeping up, and with the americans and Germans innovating, with horse drawn artillery replaced by dedicated artillery corps, and the 155mm being the next iteration, we must stay ahead of the game as a show of strength and show our enemies that we won't fall for the mistakes of our forefathers." /// elaborate with research document
 FRA_specialist_support_companies:0 "Specialist colonial companies"
 FRA_specialist_support_companies_desc:0 "Given the rough terrain that hampers our patrol brigades, and increased use of so called 'guerilla warfare' tactics, the need for logistical and military revamping of our supply chains is paramount to not repeat the mistake that our armies had suffered against the Iroqouis and or the Spanish resistance, for these beasts can only be tamed if we can fight them on their own home turf" 
 FRA_motorise_our_forces:0 "Every French officer a truck!"
 FRA_motorise_our_forces_desc:0 "Our brave and courageous Officers have time and time again complained that they've been inadequately equipped to face the front lines, as accidental cavalry dismounting has cost us rather embarrassing casualties. Lobbyists from our army call for every officer to have 'a truck for every patrol', and we can't not fund this initiative, the pride of our army depends on it!"
 FRA_study_new_cavalry:0 "Reforming the cavalry brigades"
 FRA_study_new_cavalry_desc:0 "Whilst in some countries cavalry has largely been seen as passé, the French army still sees value in them, given their importance in the history of French land warfare, dating back to the cavalry charges of the battle of Crécy, and the imprtance they played in catching french forces heading to Verdun off gaurd, costing the second French Empire dearly, we must not repeat these mistakes, and innovate were our enemies took advantage of our unprepardness."
 FRA_broaden_recruitment:0 "extending recruitement to natives"
 FRA_broaden_recruitment_desc:0 "Unlike the British, we, as enlightened forebringers to the area, have recruited and trained our subjects to fight for their colonial masters, starting from the traditions of Louis Faidherbe and the Senegalese Tirailleurs, we shall boost recruitment amongst the local inhabitants, ofcourse, restricting them to corporal status at best."
 FRA_local_ship_production:0 "Retrofitting French designs"
 FRA_local_ship_production_desc:0 "Whilst the naval bases at Marseille and Breton have been steadily producing their own naval boats for colonial purposes, it has become clear that if it were that naval lines were to be cut that our naval capabilities, and hence access to trade and vital sea routes would be compromised. With this realisation, law makers have come up with a draft on home producing our own ships, which may hamper our coffers, but would be worth it if war on the mainland were to come."
 FRA_supplement_french_patrols:0 "Applying new naval modules"
 FRA_supplement_french_patrols_desc:0 "Whispers of Dutch advancements in Submarine modular design have bespooked our naval staff, and it has been concluded that we must reiterate our destroyer fleets with new and improved Sonar and Missile Detection capabilities, which will prevent any unknowing torpidoing of our ship's rear."
 FRA_search_and_destroy:0 "search and destroy"
 FRA_search_and_destroy_desc:0 "Consistently the submarine has dominated naval warfare, and this has worried the naval staff of potential for our armies to cut off supply lines from the mainland. Introducing escort squadrons to escort our convoys and protect trade networks would prove vital to our survival for if war were to come in the European theatre."
 FRA_detect_and_repel:0 "Submarine Repellent"
 FRA_detect_and_repel_desc:0 "Learning from the Naval arms race between the British and the Huns, Paris has arrived to the conclusion that Submarine deterrence is key to conflicts at sea, and we couldn't agree more. With the vast production of nymphes and the research into the surcouf class, the possibilities of this fearsome beast have encouraged our administration to commit our own naval researchers into the initiative."
 FRA_colonial_air_department:0 "The Armée de l'Air"
 FRA_colonial_air_department_desc:0 "Air power has increasingly become an effective tool of the French coloniale administration in order to break the fog of war in our unkept and rousy areas. Investing further into improving our planes shall give us the reconnaisance advantage necessary to maintain our grip"
 FRA_clear_the_runways:0 "Clearings for runways"
 FRA_clear_the_runways_desc:0 "Whilst significant resources have been invested into our Air corps, we have found that there isn't any place to dock the damn things! This will simply not do. Therefore we must clear the forests that sprinkle the interior of our colonial holdings to give our pilots a place to land on, rather than risking them having to land on earth in a spectacle."
 FRA_import_french_air:0 "Importing French airpower"
 FRA_import_french_air_desc:0 "Whilst we like to tout our ingenuity in scraping together our supplies without French assistance, in this case there is not much of an option. Sending a telegram to Paris for even Hanriot class fighters, and, if we are lucky, Saulnier MS.406 air craft, we may be able to fill in the gaps within our own Forces Armée de l'Air."
 FRA_local_air_production:0 "Locally made warplanes"
 FRA_local_air_production_desc:0 "Perhaps contradicting the claims that we simply can not build our own air fleet as we have telegraphed to France, it seems that we have kept some reservations on our true capabilities in order to receive and at the same time build up our own squadrons. Of course respecting our Master's will is important, but it doesn't hurt to be able to get the best out of their generosity."
 FRA_call_in_the_investors:0 "Calling for investors to spend"
 FRA_call_in_the_investors_desc:0 "French trade and commerce in colonial oversees territories has always been high, with a quarter of French exports and imports travelling in and out of the colonies, however, the same can't be said for foreign investors outside of France, making up less than 30% of procurred investments. This simply won't do, and we must arrange to it that we are the beacon for future investments for cheap raw goods and materials, due to our vastly superior low costs for production."
 FRA_modern_infrastructure:0 "Rebuilding dilapidated infrastructure"
 FRA_modern_infrastructure_desc:0 "Simply put, much of our roads do not extend deep into the basins of our colony, as the ports and coasts have received the bulk of funding. However, with increased importance being given on the stability of our rural backdrops, we must put into good use our subjects so that they may not fall into vagrancy, and to lay the foundations for a mighty imperial road network.  "
 FRA_develop_export_links:0 "Developing export links"
 FRA_develop_export_links_desc:0 "With our ongoing investments into our colonies ramping up, costs have been precurring, and new sources of income are needed. Reaching out to foreign groups and leisuring trade bottlenecks would go a long way to solving the situation."
 FRA_enhance_rural_ties:0 "Connecting rural communities"
 FRA_enhance_rural_ties_desc:0 "With further integration of the inner hinterlands of our administration, we can start to build up the local towns people's area, further legitimising our guiding hand in the civilizing mission, and further spreading French values to these barbaric and destitute lands.""
 FRA_mechanise_the_mines:0 "Mechanised mining"
 FRA_mechanise_the_mines_desc:0 "Reports of miners dropping dead in their workspaces have caused great concern amongst our mining contractors, and there have been calls for the introduction of mechanisation of our mining concessions, for what is the use of a subject if we have them dropping like flies?"
 FRA_protect_farmers:0 "Protecting ranchers"
 FRA_protect_farmers_desc:0 "Given the attacks being carried out against the policy of small scale production that our administration has enforced onto farmers, pushback has resulted in many cases of reprisals from french colonial forces. Although the resistance to our proposed cultivation of coffee and cotton is undesirable, having bent up farmers who refuse to work the land as they rightfully see no reason to do so with meagre returns is understandable, and perhaps informing our penal colonial guards to simply give them a lashing would do over torture. "
 FRA_economic_subsidies:0 "Subsidizing rural devlopment"
 FRA_economic_subsidies_desc:0 "With booming investments into our industries and confidence in the market at an all time high, we finally have the ability to fund rural initiative schemes in order to further boost our agricultural output. This will go hand in hand with our plans to industrialize ourselves and finally enter our own industrial revolution."
 FRA_i_industrial_revolution:0 "Procurring Raw Materials"
 FRA_i_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "The first step in any industrial rennovation is the procurement of raw materials to build up the necessary machines. This is not an issue, as we pride ourselves in the sheer mass of gold, tin, and zinc that is in abundance. Extracting these with our massive labour pool will be plausible, and serve as further reason for investment to trickle in."
 FRA_ii_industrial_revolution:0 "Streamlining transportation"
 FRA_ii_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "The material development of French colonial possesions can be summed up in one word; Transport. Given the current high costs in porterage, limiting distance of bulwark production, to ease this, our engineers have devised new waterway systems, in order to increase our self-efficiency, with new railways in the works to connect our vast territories, and boost returns on investment."
 FRA_iii_industrial_revolution:0 "Our First Industrial Revolution"
 FRA_iii_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "Finally, after all the soil and sweat (done by our subjects of course), we have managed to shine our achievements to the world, with soaring industrial output, and being a self-sustaining colony, we can safely say that our efforts were not gone to waste, as we have proven to be economically profitable to Paris. This is truly the marking of an industrial revolution."
 
 ### EVENTS ###
 france_far_right.1.desc:0 "After over sixty years of Republican rule and the effective disappearance of overt monarchism in the French political scene, it was thought that its return was impossible. That belief was mistaken.\n\nToday, members of the Action Française entered the largely-vacant Palais du Luxembourg and Palais Bourbon, allowed entry by their comrades who already had seats in the government, and declared themselves as being the new government of France by virtue of simply occupying the halls of government.\n\nThe military seems onboard, although a vocal minority of the population is less than enthused by this turn of events, and of course virtually all of the republicans parties have declared the new regime illegitimate, to which leaders of Action Française have snidely remarked that, if they loved their republic so much, perhaps they should not have abandoned it by resigning their posts.\n\nThe leader of Action Française, Charles Maurras, has been declared regent in a ceremony that blended both ancient themes with modern political language, evoking the glory of the Ancien Régime while also calling for “national rejuvenation”. This bizarre blending of the old and the new was, fittingly, broadcast on radio and television for all French people to see and hear.\n\nHaving achieved this position by making their particular brand of monarchy as vague and inclusive as possible, it is, as of yet, unknown which of the three major royal families, the Bourbons, the Orléanists, or the Bonapartes, will be crowned. What is certain is that the Third Republic is now, officially, dead."
 
 france_far_right.2.desc:0 "It started at the crack of dawn. In every city in France, thousands of black-clad men and women took to the streets, waving black banners with a white cross and skull on them and chanting “Social d'abord!” At first it was assumed that this was just one of the many protests that the government faces on a monthly basis.\n\nBut from the start, this was something more.\n\nForming in the outlying suburbs and villages and then moving inwards to be joined by Parisians, a huge procession of supporters of the Croix-de-Fue began to make their way into the city, spearheaded by veterans of the Great War who were armed with antiquated rifles and pistols.\n\nThe Ground Army has explicitly refused to aid the government, apparently unwilling to shoot at their former comrades in arms. The Paris police and gendarmes held out for several hours, assisted, in a strange twist of fate, by several socialist and communist militias, but were eventually forced back by the sheer size of the crown. Street-fighting was fierce, but was mostly close-quarters, with clubs and fists, and so deaths were few and far between.\n\nOnce the crowd reached the Palais du Luxembourg and the Palais Bourbon, they surrounded the buildings and presented their sole demand: That their leader, François de La Rocque, be named as president of the republic.\n\nFaced with a mob hundreds of thousands strong, and with the armed forces standing idly by, the government felt that they had no choice but to acquiesce to the demand.\n\nSo ends the current iteration of Europe’s grandest republic; brought down in the same manner as Italy was. We can only hope that the new regime does not emulate their Roman counterparts too closely."
