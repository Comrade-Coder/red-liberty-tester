 CHL_wild_south_desc:0 "The lands of the Patagonian Basin have always been a precarious predicament in the side of Chilean bureaucrats and administrators alike, having to content with the aftershocks of araucanization, leading to a large Mapuche diaspora that still largely displaces the Chilean population in the region, constantly rising up and striking against so called "oppressive" conditions in mining and fishing villages.  Many view this region of our nation for what is: a land of little governance and, henceforth, a land that can be used to stow away lucrative dealings and businesses outside the central government's reach, leading to both lower and upper class strata's of the population to view it as a key bargaining chip for differing reasons."
