 united_states_flavor.1.title:0 "The New World Wall"
 united_states_flavor.1.desc:0 "Jimmy Sear strode on top of his creation. Well, it wasn't exactly his creation; but the project he was employed to work on for the last five years had a special place in his heart. The project which gave him work, shelter for his family, and the wages to put food on the table was none other then the Boulder Dam. A massive project, spearheaded by the American Government to tame the Colorado river which would provide power and water for the denizens living in Nevada, Arizona, Utah and beyond.\n\nBehind him walked his family of three who had moved to Colorado to find work. Alongside them were many other workers family who also worked on the Dam. Many of his fellow workers: including Jimmy himself had lost their jobs from the depression and without the intervention from the Government in Washington; they would all most likely be unemployed and many homeless. The benevolence from the State towards Jimmy and his fellow proletariat allowed his fellow workers to regain their dignity thanks to the socialist economic policies which allowed the workers to build this great marvel of American engineering.\n\nJimmy then walked to the edge of the new construction, to marvel at the engineering feet which he had contributed towards. The sweat and tears of his labour were laid before him. Seven hundred feet and counting below him was the great Boulder Dam, holding back the rush of the Colorado river.  Jimmy's heart swelled with pride from just looking at his work. The Dam took the lowliest of American workers from their feet and once more put the workers back on their feet. Jimmy was grateful: towards the Dam which gave him work; his family also, who gave their undying support and respect to the Socialist Party of America, for without their support he would of never found work. Now the Dam stands as a monument not towards old America, Jimmy had realised; but to the hope of a new age for Jimmy and his fellow workers."

The one day in which the masses routinely come together as one and make the world tremble before their combined power: May Day, the day of the workers.\n\nAround the world, in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, London, Madrid, Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Moscow, and Tokyo, the workers spill forth from their apartments, slums, and factories to fill the streets with flowing parades, red and black banners fluttering as the air is filled with the International, the Commonwealth of Toil, and the Worker's Marseillaise.\n\nThe forces of reaction and capital cower in their gilded halls of crime, and wait out the storm that is the day of the working class."
 
 united_states_flavor.3.title:0 "A Rhode Island Newspaper Article"
 united_states_flavor.3.desc:0 ""It will not have escaped the notice of those who have often corresponded with me that, for much of my life, I have held certain ideas about class, race, and culture that some would consider backwards. I can better understand the inert blindness & defiant ignorance of the reactionaries from having been one of them. I know how smugly ignorant I was—wrapped up in the arts, the natural (not social) sciences, the externals of history & antiquarianism, the abstract academic phases of philosophy, and so on—all the one-sided standard lore to which, according to the traditions of the dying order, a liberal education was limited. God! the things that were left out—the inside facts of history, the rational interpretation of periodic social crises, the foundations of economics and sociology, the actual state of the world today... And above all, the habit of applying disinterested reason to problems hitherto approached only with traditional genuflections, flag-waving, and callous shoulder-shrugs!\n\n"I sit and write now a changed man. While once I sneered at liberals for what I saw as their their degeneracy and blind optimism, and the socialists for their destruction of the elite who I believed drove society onwards, I do so no longer.\n\n"I cannot speak to the entire nation. But I can speak to my friends and correspondents and community: I hereby endorse Norman Thomas for President of the United States. In his campaign lies the only hope for our great nation, to save us from the reactionary and the Marxist. If the many vile words I have written on the subject of race and class and religion mean anything to you, perhaps then these words will mean something too.""
 
 united_states_flavor.4.desc:0 ""Citizens of the United States!" President Thomas addressed the assembled masses, tens of thousands strong. "We stand here today among the achievements of our forefathers," he swept his arm around to gesture at the White House, the Congress Building, and the Lincoln Memorial, "and this is the day we celebrate their choice, the choice that set America's course towards its god-given destiny of prosperity and greatness, the choice of independence, the choice of revolution!"\n\nThe crowd roared in approval, and Thomas waited patiently for them to fall silent again.\n\n"And today I tell you this: The American revolution isn't over! It was never over! Our revolution is eternal, and our holy father smiles upon us as it progresses. God's grace is with us as we bring liberty and civilization to the world! The Founders, John Brown, Abraham Lincoln, the feminists, all were doing God's divine will and spreading the holy light of freedom further. And our revolution shall continue unabated, so that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth!"\n\nAs Thomas finished the most fiery sermon he'd yet given, the gathered thousands once again roared; thunderous applause spilling over the president as fireworks began to explode in the sky above. Truly, no country could ever be as great as the United States."

 united_states_flavor.5.desc:0 "Pittsburgh is drowning. Due to unseasonably hot weather, the frozen rivers of Pennsylvania began to melt. Normally this would take months but due to the warm spell, it melted within days. This water rushed down Pittsburgh's famous three rivers. The water came so fast that no warning could be sent out. In some areas, water surged up to forty-five feet. This flooded the entirety of Pittsburgh with about twenty feet of water for days. Sixty-five percent of Pittsburgh’s downtown was flooded beyond repair. The entire power grid has been knocked out and misinformation is spreading quickly. Some doctors predict a typhoid epidemic is upcoming for Pennsylvania and Ohio. The steel mills that employ 10% of the local population have been wiped out. In the history of America, we have never seen destruction on this scale. It has gotten so out of hand that first responders can not estimate total fatalities due to the vast majority of Pittsburgh being inaccessible. It seems like this will set Pittsburgh behind the other steel belt cities’ economically for decades. We can be sure that eventually, Pittsburgh will retain its status as the capital of American industry. For now, America must help Pittsburgh back on its feet."

 united_states_flavor.6.desc:0 "The Great New England hurricane has finally made landfall. The people of Connecticut have known of the incoming hurricane for the past five days, but nobody, not even the weather service, could imagine how violent it was going to be. It was projected to be a moderately large hurricane, which was certainly unusual for the region. But it turns out that this hurricane has been the most violent hurricane seen in American history. Indeed, if it wasn’t for the weather service spotting it, the hurricane could have easily become the most fatal in American history as well. It has shredded through every building in its path from Bridgeport, Connecticut all the way to the Canadian border.\n\nAs if the wind wasn’t destructive enough, the floods it has caused are even worse. In Long Island, waves more than fourteen feet high were recorded. Almost all of southern New England was battered by ten-plus foot waves. Most phone and telegraph lines have been toppled, so information is rather scant. An estimated 600 to 1000 people have died. We cannot be sure, but most experts believe the hurricane has caused multiple hundred of millions of dollars in damage. Luckily multiple charity organizations are on the scene trying to find temporary housing for the people. A small-town writer from the area, a Mr. Howard Philips Lovecraft, has been receiving significant praise over the past few days, for his support of relief efforts, and his pledge that the proceeds for his next book would go to rebuilding New England. We as Americans must unite to support the families affected by the hurricane."

 united_states_flavor.7.desc:0 "The Battle of Blair Mountain was an armed conflict between union coal miners and the federal government. On this day twenty years ago this battle started. Around one hundred and twenty people died, the vast majority of which were the coal miners and the local police force. Most agree that the federal government used excessive force in dealing with the riot. The battle was the first time the American government dropped bombs from airplanes on American soil. The miners only had pistols and rifles to defend themselves from the bombs. Most had never seen an airplane and they did not fully realize their fate. Many critics of the miners argue that those measures were necessary to stop the occupation and chaos that occurred in the counties they occupied. The miners occupied four counties in West Virginia for 8 days. This was by far the largest armed insurrection in the US since the Civil War. Today the battle of Blair Mountain is considered one of the most divisive topics in America. Most union workers and people from the region think the miners were martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the betterment of the working class. Most anti-socialists and moderates believe the miners were anti-American terrorists who killed others wantonly over minor issues. Today both the moderate and radical socialists demand something to be done. The radicals managed to force the bill through committee and demand that the president make an executive order. The radicals want today to be a national holiday in order to remember the warriors who sacrificed their lives for freedom. The moderates demand that any attempts to create a holiday celebrating these ruffians is a disgrace to America. Accepting the order will outrage many but will show Americans that it is your civic duty to fight tyranny. Rejection of the order will bring a sense of normalcy in America and proclaims that America will never bow down to terrorists"

 united_states_flavor.9.title:0 "The Death of John Clem"
 united_states_flavor.9.desc:0 "John Lincoln Klem, nicknamed Johnny Shiloh, was a famous serviceman within the United States Armed Forces - the last active duty veteran of the Civil War. John Clem gained his initial fame during the Civil War when at the young age of eleven, he shot and killed a Confederate Colonel that had demanded his surrender after a Union Rout on the field. The young boy was captured, and used for Confederate propaganda for the rest of the Civil War. Following the defeat of the Southern Traitors, Clem, rose through the ranks faster than any man ever had, becoming the youngest NCO in American History, then immediately after, the youngest Officer. He had reached the rank of Major General before retiring from the American Army in 1917.\n\nThis American Hero lived peacefully alongside his wife and children for twenty years until passing away this year, in 1937. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetary and his story has had a largescale resurgence in popularity, inspiring many young boys to rush to their recruiting offices in an attempt to join the army - although their rejection led to much dismay among the child population. John Clem will surely go down in history as one of America's youngest heroes."

 united_states_flavor.10.desc:0 "The United States of America has rarely known a man more in line with the proletariat than Vice President Jack Reed. Having gained prominence during the first world war for his journalism from the frontlines of the conflict, keeping the workers and lower classes informed on what he deemed to be a ¨Rich man´s conflict¨, the aristocracy of the Old World throwing the lives of the peasants against each other. On multiple occasions, the man was even arrested, suspected of committing espionage as he snuck over national borders in order to get closer to the major battlefields of the Great War.\n\nFollowing his service in the Red Guard during the Russian Civil War, Jack Reed returned to the United States to preach Socialistic and Authoritarian Communist beliefs throughout his homeland, in multiple instances advocating for a similar Armed Revolution of the Workers within the United States. These speeches, alongside his wartime journalism, afforded him largescale popularity within the American left, and more specifically the more radical wings of the Socialist Party of America. Although considered dangerous even by his fellow party members, no successful attempt was ever made to dislodge him from the party.\n\nHaving declined another term as Vice President due to his worsening condition due to Typhus, Vice President Reed spent the last few years of his life alongside his wife, Louise Bryant, a similarly radical journalist, and his two children, Silas and George Reed. Before inevitably passing away this year, 1938, at home, surrounded by his family. He is to be given a state funeral and it is expected dignitaries from the Soviet Union may even be in attendance."

 ###united_states_flavor.4.desc:0 "My fellow citizens. We are assembled here today to celebrate the one-hundred and sixtieth anniversary of the birth of our great democracy.\n\nIn 1776 we sought freedom from the tyranny of a political autocracy – from the eighteenth century royalists who held special privileges from the crown. It was to perpetuate their privilege that they governed without the consent of the governed; that they denied the right of free assembly and free speech; that they restricted the worship of God; that they put the average man’s property and the average man’s life in pawn to the mercenaries of dynastic power; that they regimented the people.\n\nAnd so it was to win freedom from the tyranny of political autocracy that the American Revolution was fought. That victory gave the business of governing into the hands of the average man, who won the right with his neighbors to make and order his own destiny through his own Government. Political tyranny was wiped out at Philadelphia on that fateful day of July 4, 1776.\n\nNow, here we stand, one hundred and sixty years later, and man’s inventive genius has released new forces in our land, which reordered the lives of our people. The age of machinery, of railroads; of steam and electricity; the telegraph and the radio; mass production, mass distribution – all of these combined to bring forth a new civilization, and with it a new problem for those who sought to remain free.\n\nI speak, of course, of economic tyranny. For out of this modern civilization, economic royalists carved new dynasties. New kingdoms were built upon concentration of control over material things. Through new uses of corporations, banks and securities, new machinery of industry and agriculture, of labor and capital – all undreamed of by the fathers – the whole structure of modern life was impressed into this royal service.\n\nAgainst tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of Government. The collapse of 1929 showed up the despotism for what it was. The election of 1932 was the people’s mandate to end it. Under that mandate it is being ended."

 ### GENERAL EVENTS THAT WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN ###
 united_states.1.desc:0 "The Winner Take All electoral system of the United States of America has long meant that, in practice, two parties dominate the country's politics, from the local level up to the national level. Once a party has secured the presidency even once, their electoral fortunes are essentially assured for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor the better part of a century, the Democratic and Republican parties used this fact to their advantage. Both were capitalist in flavour; although the specifics varied by date and party, it was known that neither would ever become friendly to socialists in their ranks, making, at best, meaningless concessions to the interests of the working class.\n\nIt was long assumed that the system's strength lay in its rigidity. The simple fact that a party must win the presidency to be taken seriously on the national level would forever protect the Democrats and Republicans from meaningful competition.\n\nWhat they failed to count on was the growing anger of the American people. After the presidency of William McKinley came to an end and Theodore Roosevelt was once again run as a vice-presidential candidate by the Republican National Convention, it was clear to the progressives of the day that the Republicans would sooner die than let one of their own into the White House. Partyless, America's workers and progressive began to defect en-mass from the Republicans and Democrats. They found refuge in a wide variety of third parties but soon began to coalesce around the Socialist Party of America and its charismatic leader, Eugene Debs.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1912 election had come and gone that, in a flash, the leaders of the two foremost parties in the land realized their catastrophic miscalculation. On the fourth of March, 1913, Eugene Debs was sworn in as President of the United States, and the nation and the world were forever changed.\n\nMuch has happened in the USA since then, and the Socialist Party has been out of power but never out of prominence. Norman Thomas, an avowed socialist but fierce anti-communist all the same, now sits as president, preparing to run for his second term. The two-party system has fractured as the socialists drain away support from the big two and run spoiler candidates in races, allowing third parties to worm into local politics. It is unknown what course America shall take, but it must be charted very carefully."

 united_states.3.desc:0 "Whilst this year's Democratic convention is as packed as usual, with various political factions, namely from the antebellum south, and the more northern progressive wing, who have been juxtaposed to the staunch borderline socialist policies of the Socialist Party of America that has continued to squeeze out the previously held Republican strongholds, showing themselves as open towards federal programs, yet rearing in when it comes to taxation of businesses and of complete desegregation of the armed forces or of repealing jim crow laws, which Joseph Lister Hill, although a southerner, aligning himself with this faction of the democratic party the most, yet with his own quirks with regards to states rights, namely, for blacks.\n\nBorn in Montgomery Alabama, Lister had his path towards shaping medical policy by his own father, a surgeon who inspired by the work of Dr. Joseph lister, named his son after him, which he astoundingly accomplished within the senate, passing comprehensive healthcare, pushing for the Hill-Burton Act, which even progressives outside of his own party supported open-heartedly, showing his skills at playing both sides of the democratic party, and even members outside of it within the senate.\n\nAlthough seeming borderline progressive with regards to federal reach in the case of healthcare and education, his views on segregation within the armed forces, with him having served in the military himself, remains controversial, although propping his image for the more White Protestants, who deem the encroachment of undesirables in their neighbourhoods with the passing of progressive legislation as costing jobs in their area. Whether controversial to one side or the other, Lister is the perfect liberal moderate figurehead to spear through a democratic agenda through an America that has seemed to have fallen so far off its commitments to the first amendment and to the constitution, whilst championing policies for the working man."

The nominees in the front running are the following;\n\nHenry Wallace, the Secretary of Agriculture under the current Presidency, Wallace seeks largescale agricultural reform and conciliatory policies with the Russian Communists in Moscow. The Secretary is far more popular among the base of the party which is made up of moderates who seek slow but steady change in the right direction.\n\nEarl Browder spurred on the belief that the leaders of both the Democratic and Republican Parties are possible Fascist Dictators in the making, seeks to establish unity and work alongside Socialists and moderates within the party in order to achieve greater and more radical change within the United States to ensure no dictatorship can occur. He is not opposed to making concessions to secure unity, but many within the party still consider him a dangerous man.\n\nWhich of these two the Socialist Party of America will choose to take the second most powerful position in the United States is largely determined in the next few days... a heavy choice to make considering the possibility of one of these men becoming President themselves one day."

Too distracted to notice the door, his secretary walked in. "Mr. President?" A man asked. "I just received word of men arming themselves in Michigan. Should we send troops there just in case?" Thomas stared at him for a few seconds. "I don’t know if I should... they are still civilians after all. Didn’t I promise peace?" The man looked at the president again. "Thomas, there was a woman in Pennsylvania who lost her husband. We can’t let such things continue!" Thomas stared at him again. "I guess I have no choice then...I will do what I must. I’m signing the Insurrection Act." With that, Thomas would go to the capitol to deliver his next speech, stating that it was time that Americans used full force against the "unpatriotic militants."

A deafening roar of approval washed over him as he stepped into sight of the crowd. Taking a moment to shake hands with fellow Socialist Party member and mayor of the city, Fiorello La Guardia, he then stepped forward in front of the microphones.\n\n"Working men and women of New York city and state, it is an honor to stand before you today!"\n\nAnother wave of applause and cheers washed over him.\n\n"I stand today amidst a red metropolis! New York City, under the leadership of La Guardia and with the aid of its countless socialist inhabitants, has excised corruption from the city council, has cast down the petty oligarchs of Tammany Hall, has dragged vile gangsters to prison, and has built vast public works that are the envy of even such cities as London, Paris, and Berlin! New York is a shining beacon to the nation and the world; a beacon of socialist promises made and fulfilled to their greatest extent! New York is the city of the future!"\n\nHe paused as the applause once again grew deafening. This was mostly theater; New York City itself was a clinch for the Socialist Party, and had been since the twenties. There wasn’t much proper campaigning to be done here. Still, it felt quite good to stand before tens of thousands of people and make a little victory lap. Smiling to himself, he continued his speech."

 united_states_thomas.2.desc:0 "President Thomas walked up on stage. He looked over the crowd and hesitated. It seemed to be one of the largest crowds he had ever spoken to, easily numbering in the thousands. He began to sweat. He had always been an author first, not a public speaker. Still, these were mostly striking workers and SPA voters. It should go smoothly, he thought.\n\n"Good afternoon, Flint, Michigan!" Thomas said cheerfully into the microphone. The crowd roared. "I hear you boys have done a mighty fine job of organizing. Been on strike for 3 weeks? Good on you, men. Good on you." He chuckled slightly. "I read an interview in the paper last week with Alfred Sloan, the big boss here at GM." He gave the crowd time to jeer at his name. "He seemed awfully nervous about the strike. I think you all have got him on the run!" The crowd cheered and hollered more, waving their signs.\n\nOn them were written all sorts of slogans, quotes from Marx, and insults at Mr. Sloan and local management. There were large banners colored black and red with SPA and IWW symbols emblazoned on them. As President Thomas looked over the cheering crowd, full of workers with both their fists and voices raised, he was proud. This is what he wanted America to look like. Thousands of working people, united in their knowledge of their own interests and needs. As he drifted off into thought, he realized that he had been silent for some time and the cheering was dying down.\n\n"You know, Alfred Sloan mentioned me in that interview with the Times," Thomas said, forming a sly smile. "He said, 'all this anarchist worker agitation is the fault of these socialists in office.'" The crowd began to boo. "Now wait, folks," the President spoke over them. "He gave me the best compliment I’ve received in all my time in office. He said, 'Because of the labor laws put forward by that communist Norman Thomas, my hands are tied and I can’t do anything to stop this strike.'" The President laughed. "And if that isn’t a reason to be proud of what we in the SPA have achieved, nothing is!"\n\nThe crowd went wild, cheering so loudly that Thomas almost felt pushed back by their sheer volume, and as he looked over the faces of all the uncountable number of striking workers, he knew that Alfred Sloan was right to be afraid, because these workers were the finest that American labor had to offer. As he looked on with pride, a chant was picked up in the crowd, and Thomas wiped a joyful tear from his eye."

 united_states_thomas.3.desc:0 "The President looked across the camp. The people watching him were thin as twigs and seemed to lack all spirit. The way Labor Secretary Perkins explained it to him did not show the reality of the situation at all. She said that in California there was a surplus of migrant workers and a shortage of jobs, so wages were low and conditions were bad. Her briefing did not prepare Thomas to see the absolute destitution and misery that this migrant work camp displayed. Dozens of eyes were upon him as he stood in front of a small crowd.\n\n"So, where are you all from?" Thomas asked, forcing an awkward smile.\n\n"We’re from Oklahoma," said one woman in the crowd. "We came here for work, and there ain’t none."\n\nThomas was taken aback by the bluntness of her words. No one had spoken to him like that before. "Well, there’s a government camp just a few miles north of here that’s a part of the Recovery Acts. They can give you work and see to your needs if you wish."\n\n"That’s where I came from!" yelled a man from the back of the crowd. "They ain’t got the money to pay us or food to feed us! It looks just like here, except the coppers harass ya when you try to get in!"\n\nThomas looked on in shock. "The police are opposing the Recovery?" he asked incredulously. A few people in the crowd laughed at his disbelief.\n\n"‘Course they are," said a teenage boy. "All the coppers ‘round here are crooked. The planters pay ‘em more than the state does. All they do is harass us, and wave guns at anyone who tries to organize."\n\n"Just two days back, they shot my brother for strikin’!" a young girl cried. "Killed him dead!"\n\nThomas looked to one of his aides. "It’s much worse here than I thought. We should go." He gave a brief farewell to the crowd and turned to walk away. As he did, however, a woman pushed his way past his bodyguards and grabbed him by the arm.\n\n"Mister President, sir," she pleaded to him. "It’s so much worse here than it looks. I’ve fed grown men here with my own breast milk because they’d starve to death otherwise. We want a recovery, sir, so, so badly, but we ain’t getting one here." She let go of his arm as tears began to flow from her eyes. Norman opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. After a few moments, she turned and walked back to the crowd."

 united_states_thomas.5.desc:0 "President Thomas stood on a podium before a large crowd of working men on an unused dock, where his platform had been set up. There were at least four hundred people in attendance, a fair number. He’d speak to thousands before his time in Chicago was finished.\n\nThe city’s main industries were meat packing and metalworking, and his speech had been planned accordingly. What hadn’t been planned for was the fact that a significant minority of the people who appeared at his rallies in the city were African American.\n\nUpon asking, he’d been informed by a black campaign aid that this was because of something called the “Great Northward Migration”. Its causes were varied but predictable; racial violence and lack of economic opportunity in the South were driving African Americans norward to seek employment in Northern cities, like Chicago. With this in mind, he’d adjusted his speeches accordingly.\n\n"Working men of Chicago!" He began, addressing the crowd with a warm smile. "We stand in a city built by your toil. A city of towering buildings, massive factories, and sprawling stockyards; all great monuments to progress. But they are more than that. They are monuments to labor; your labor! For too long, rich men in those tall buildings have decided your fate for you. They have taken the fruits of your labor and used them as they saw fit! They have built libraries and opera houses and theaters and hotels. But what good are libraries when your children cannot read? What good is opera and theater when your meager pay cannot buy you a ticket? What good are hotels when you don’t have the time for vacation?"\n\nFrom among the crowd came grumbled agreement; heads nodding, eyes locked on Thomas as he gave voice to their frustrations.\n\n"Comrades, the Socialist Party of America hears you! If we are given your mandate, we shall ensure that no longer will your hard labor go towards luxuries that you yourself are denied! Your children will have schools, your family will have the money for entertainment and cultural edification, and you will have generous time away from work to spend at your leisure! The Republicans and Democrats have had decades to fulfill these same promises, and they have lied time and time again. The Socialists are a worker’s party, your fate is ours! We will never forget you, and never abandon you!"\n\nThere as a generous round of applause, and hollers of support arose from the assembly.\n\nSwallowing nervously, Thomas began the second part of his speech, careful not to let the nervousness make his voice waver. "I see assembled before me today members from both races of America, black and white. No matter where we hail from, we are all Americans, drawn here by God-given opportunity. At time like this, where the segregationists seek to divide the working class along artificial lines and make it tear itself apart so that a few tycoons and tyrants might profit, we must remember that we are all in this fight together, regardless of race or creed! God bless America, and God bless the working class!"\n\nThe applause was louder now, supplemented by cheering, although Thomas suspected that it was more from his invocation of god than his preaching about racial equality. Either way, it made him smile."

It didn’t seem to be phasing Senator Huey Long at all though, who was still giving a lively diatribe. "I know President Thomas wants to help the common people, he really does, and I admire that. But how much has his red Recovery really done for them? Something, sure, but not enough! Certainly nowhere near as much as my Share Our Wealth plan would!" The crowd murmured in agreement.\n\nThomas cut in. "I like your Share Our Wealth program, I really do! I wish my Recovery plan could look more like it," he said. The crowd looked with curiosity. "In fact, maybe it could, if Huey Long and his fellow AFP members would support it so that we didn’t have to compromise with the Republicans and Democrats for votes!" The crowd had been captured. Thomas had always been a more talented author than public speaker, but he had a chance here. He could make them cheer. He turned to Long. "But how is it that you think you can collectivize the capital of a society without collectivizing the means by which that capital is produced?" The crowd was silent. Titled heads and raised eyebrows were all that met his gaze. He lost it.\n\nLong pounced. "Now what in blazes is that supposed to mean? You’re talkin’ about socialism? Now there’s a good reason we don’t do socialism." Long smiled and spoke more loudly to the crowd. "Cause socialism destroys nations! We’ve seen what socialism did to Russia, and it’s a good thing that America remains a democracy or they’d do the same thing here! Our opposition is the only thing saving America from a red terror!" The crowd roared and cheered.\n\nLong softened his tone. "Capitalism isn’t just an economic system, folks. It’s a God-given mandate for the American people that dates all the way back to the Israelites and the Ten Commandments. 'Thou shalt not covet.' These reds, folks, they covet everything. Under socialism, you wouldn’t even get to own your own garters." The crowd nodded in agreement. President Thomas knew he couldn’t compete with Long’s oratories ability, even though Long was talking nonsense.

If the Socialist Party was truly to become America’s leading party then it would need popular support. More so, at least, than it currently had.\n\nThomas stared down at the list and smiled. It was a grand who’s who of socialist mainstays, from W.E.B. Du Bois to Emma Goldman.\n\nIt was a radical list, to be sure. A more radical government had never been assembled since Lincoln’s day. But these were radical times, and it wouldn’t do to stick with stodgy liberal-capitalist political thinking. That was a dying breed, and Thomas had no wish to resuscitate it.\n\nThe cabinet he was putting together would be unconventional, and Goldman’s inclusion would definitely raise some eyebrows, but it would show the people that, without a doubt, the Socialist Party was committed to socialism and the liberation of all men and women.\n\nThat was the only real way to gain popular support, Thomas decided, leaning back in his chair with a smile on his face. Appeal to the people directly, and show them that the Socialist Party had their interests at heart first and foremost, not the pleadings and mutterings of the capitalist parties."

"It’s part of a scheme the tycoons cooked up to get you out of power. The first step was causing the economy to crash again, on purpose this time. Then they came forward to me, and asked me to lead a coup against you. They think I’m popular, and they came to me because I led capitalist interventions in Latin America to prop up business interests there. They thought I’d be willing to do the same here; to get me to lead an army of veterans, organized through the American Legion, into Washington, coup the government, and install a fascist dictatorship."\n\n"And, since you’re sitting here telling me this, would I be correct in assuming that you’re not?"\n\n"You would be correct, sir."\n\nThere was a long moment of silence. President Thomas rubbed his temples, sighing. "Thank you for telling me, General Butler. I’m very grateful for your faith in my administration. I understand that you have some reservations about our more radical policies, but your loyalty to the Constitution in spite of us is outstanding."\n\nButler merely nodded.\n\n"Who do you know for sure was in on the conspiracy?"\n\n"Henry Ford, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, Gerald C. MacGuire, Bill Doyle, Grayson Murphy, and Robert Sterling Clark. They’re the ones I met in person. They mentioned others, I have a full list in a notebook."\n\n"I’ll inform the FBI and have a House committee look into the matter." Seeing Butler open his mouth, Thomas cut him off. "I know, I know. They might be compromised; capitalist influence is still strong, especially in the FBI, but it’s our only course of action that won’t cause a constitutional crisis.""
 
 united_states_thomas.11.desc:0 ""They say they can’t find any solid evidence." Thomas shrugged, looking across the Resolute Desk at General Butler. "I don’t believe them, of course. From what I can see from here, they did the bare minimum they could get away with and then declared the case closed."\n\nButler sighed, leaning back in his chair. "It was perhaps foolish of me to think that we could catch the racketeers in the act. They cover their tracks too well."\n\n"The FBI noted that they couldn’t confirm the locations of the people you mentioned at the time you said that you were meeting with them, but people hardly leave their schedules lying around anyway, and 'not being where we think you ought to be' isn’t a crime nor is it particularly compelling evidence of a crime, so my hands are tied here, Smedley. The best we can do is stay vigilant. I’m shuffling the military administration to ensure that there are loyal men in key strategic positions, should the worst happen, but otherwise we are without recourse at the moment."\n\nThe general nodded. "You can count on my loyalty in such a situation, Mr. President, as much as I pray it won’t come to pass." His commander-in-chief dismissed him, and the general stood to gather his coat. Looking over his shoulder, he said. "And I’m sorry about the negative press all this has brought on you. You’ve probably seen the New York Times, calling us and the congressional committee a gang of witch-hunters."\n\nThomas sighed. "It’s nothing new, I assure you. The capitalist press has never been friendly to socialists. We’ll weather the storm like all that have come before it, and come out stronger than before."\n\n"Indeed. Good day, Mr. President.""

"I don't want to go, of course, but I don't feel like I have much choice. Damn typhus. It spent too long in me in Russia, and now no doctor in this whole damned country can get it out of me." The circles under his eyes seemed to grow darker as he slumped back into his chair. "I'm so sorry, Norman. I have to do this. I can't keep this up anymore. I'm too old for this."\n\nThe vice president stared down at the floor, and Norman could swear he saw tears glistening in his eyes. "We're the old guard, Norman. We're the only ones who remember the good old days, back when Eugene and Bill were still here." It was an exaggeration, but not much of one. A lot of the newer party members had been sucking their thumbs when Debs was president.\n\nPresident Thomas sighed, his own eyes directed down at his desk. He suddenly felt empty and cold; old.\n\n"I'll be with you until the end of this term. We'll have to have a primary in the party to find my successor."\n\nThomas nodded.\n\n"... Tom. Promise me you'll finish the job. No half-measures, like Labour did in Britain. We can't sell out now; we're so close to the end. We can break capital's back if we win the next election. We just need one more push. Promise me you won't sell out."\n\nReed had always been more radical than Thomas. Their friendship had gotten off to a rocky start when Thomas had been informed of Reed's adventure in Russia and subsequent flirtation with Leninism, to say nothing of his unabashed Marxism.

You can't do this!" He pushed his way through the crowd, shouldering jeering men and women aside to get to the front, where he was held back by National Guardsmen. "Hey! Yankee!" He yelled at an engineer observing the truck, who turned to face him curiously. "Put it back! You can't fucking do this!"\n\n"I ain't a yankee; I'm from Minnesota. And why not?" The uniformed man grinned amusedly, like this was all a big joke. "We did it before."\n\nEverett stared at him.\n\n"What, you don't know? We've got your battle-flag! A Minnesota unit captured it at Gettysburg. Finders keepers, ya know. Your state keeps trying to get it back, and some fella tried to sue us for it around the turn of the century. We ain't never givin' it back! Don't worry, we ain't gonna keep the statue. Dunno what's gonna be done with it, but hey, that's not really my business. We're lettin' ya keep the pedestal, though. You can do whatever you want with it. Just don't put any more traitors on it."\n\n"What if we came up to your state and took down your statues! How would it feel?!" Everett yelled.\n\n"Well, we don't really make a habit of putting up statues of traitors who tried to destroy the Union, but hey, maybe if you elect the right guy it'll be your turn to give it a shot. Just remember how it went the last time you fellows tried dictate terms to the North." He walked away to supervise the securing of the state, leaving Everett spluttering furiously."

 united_states_thomas.26.title:0 "The All-Mighty Ballot"
 united_states_thomas.26.desc:0 "The sun beat down on Katherine as she stood in line, but she didn't mind. She was pretty happy to be allowed to stand in this line to begin with. In front of her, the town courthouse loomed above, a banner reading "Polling Station" hanging from a pair of second story windows.\n\nSoldiers and military police milled around, finding shady spots under trees or awnings to observe the gathered civilians. The Ohio National Guard, federalized and called in to supervise elections south of the Mason Dixon line, by order of President Thomas.\n\nShe felt less unwelcome than expected; some of the whites seemed unphased by her presence, while others shot her threatening stares from time to time, but no one dared try anything under the watchful eye of the guard. She was far from the only colored person in the line; they were actually the majority in this county, but hadn't been allowed to vote since Reconstruction. If anyone worked up the nerve to go to the polls, they found themselves demanded to recite the constitution from memory to prove that they were literate, and if they managed that, well... what followed was a usually a noose.\n\nShe stepped inside the courthouse lobby, which was baking like an oven. A clerk glanced up and handed her a ballot, indicating a table off to the right with dividers set up on it. "There. And there's a pen there already. Drop it in the box over there. Any box." He pointed at a line of ballot boxes on the opposite side of the room, watched over by a pair of federal marshals and a bored-looking major.\n\nKatherine nodded and stepped over to the table. Setting the ballot down, she uncapped a pen and looked over her options. For the first time in her life, the political destiny of her nation was in her own hands. She smiled, and began filling out the ballot."

 united_states_thomas.27.desc:0 ""It's a nice apartment. The government's paying for it?" Laurence asked.\n\n"Just one third of the rent. Subsidies." Eddy responded.\n\nThey were sitting at the dining room table in said apartment, their chairs side-by-side.\n\n"Can you believe it?" Eddy continued. "Born on a dirt farm in Oklahoma and now I'm living like a king. I'm saving up for a car next. I don't even know what I'd do with it; there's a tram that goes by the cannery, so I don't need to drive." His voice lacked enthusiasm, obviously not content despite his prosperity. "But since I can have it, why not?"\n\nIt was Laurence's turn to sigh. "I remember when you said that about this apartment... And the air conditioner... And the medical insurance... And the life insurance... And the leather boots..." Each sentence was punctuated with a heavy, oppressive pause.\n\n"I can have them. Might as well." Eddy murmured, his eyes dropping to stare down at the table. "I can have everything. Except what I really want." He kicked the table, scuffing his boot and scowling as his toe smarted painfully. "All the cars in the world. All the houses in the world. All the boots in the world. All the money in the world. I could have all of it. Wouldn't mean anything to me." He kicked the table again with the other foot, not as hard.\n\nLaurence's hand found Eddy's, wrapping around it and gently rubbing the palm with his thumb. They shared a long glance. "Better to be hidden and rich than hidden and poor. And it's not as if any of the other candidates would've done us any better. At least we have well-paying jobs and good apartments." Laurence looked up at the sturdy brick walls. "It affords more privacy than a shanty. Perhaps Norman is helping us, in his own secret way."\n\nIt was a fanciful statement, but Eddy found himself liking it. Soothing lies had always been more comfortable than unfeeling truth."

Though at times he professed moderation and at other times required nudging, at the end of the day he almost always choose the right path, no matter how unthinkable it had been at the time. What was right and what was convenient were rarely the same.\n\nTom thought about that a lot as he marched with his comrades of the Lincoln Battalion under the bright New Mexico sun, cold, dry wind whipping at his face and making his lips chap and peel. It had never occurred to him that it was possible for a desert to be cold, and yet here it was. Snow still clung to the ground behind red boulders and leafless scrub. He gasped for breath on every other step, so far above sea level that the air was noticeably thinner.\n\nOfficially, the border was closed to crossings in either direction, but there wasn’t much of a practical way to enforce that along the two-thousand miles that stretched from the Gulf to the Pacific. Especially not here. So he and his comrades his gone to Santa Fe by rail and then trekked south to the border.\n\nHe looked up, and for the first time saw two figures atop a ridge, looking down at them. One clambered down to meet the advancing column, a strip of faded red cloth around his arm. Dark eyes peered out from under a worn sombrero. "Welcome to Mexico, comrades.""

 united_states_mproject.1.desc:0 ""Well Mc, how's the results from the latest bombardment looking?" Querried Dr. Glenn to his colleague, buttoned from head to toe in white gear as they conducted experiments in their little repository within the University of California, tantively waiting for results to report. "Considering the results, I'd say the reaction I've gathered is a typical case of uranium molecules ripping apart the electrons from the proton base, however, I have to say, something looks different with this result."\n\n"Is that what I think that means then?" Eagerly asked Wahl, standing just a few metres away analysing the data that was oozing with new properties, vehemently passionate about the potential history they'd be making with such a discovery of a new isotope. "Well, if I were to give a scientifically evaluated answer..." paused Mc, with a squinted face, as his colleagues leaned over. "...I'd assess this to be a new isotope we have here gentleman"\n\nAll of a sudden the manneurisms that these scientists wore as if it were their skin melted away, as they cackled with excitement, given the value and potential of this discovery that they'd been working on for months now, with no luck at the cyclotron that they possessed. "Blimey me, haven't felt so amped since ol' Wahl found the bathrooms clogged with phosphorous!" chuckling aloud, at the expense of Wahl, who was still embarrassed about the event in question. "Say then, what do you think we should call this new isotope then?" pondered Mc, with all looking towards Glenn as their ring leader."

"Well, believe what your eyes see, commander, for this is what will be the weapon to neuter all weapons of war, and it's in the hands of the greatest country to be graced by almighty God." the President said proudly and sternly, certain that this destructive force of nature in the hands of America could bring democracy to the bloody theatre in Europe, and end anymore unnecessary bloodshed, even if the very sight of this all consuming bomb made him silently quiver with the foreboding aurora that gripped the now ghastly view before him."
