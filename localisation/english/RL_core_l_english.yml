 BREAD_AND_ROSES_NAME:0 "Bread and Roses"
 BREAD_AND_ROSES_DESC:0 "The World was paralyzed following the results of the First World War, tens of millions of young men have died for what seemed to be little to no gain in Europe or abroad. Socialist thought, once deemed degenerate and deranged is now commonplace and one of the world´s largest powers stands firmly under the Presidency of Norman Thomas, leader of the Socialist Party of America. The world is a far different place than the one dreamed about at the beginning of the century - will you aid the revolution of the common man, achieving equality for all? Or will you strike it down in the name of individual freedom and finance, striving for a world of the renewed American Dream?"
 USA_BREAD_AND_ROSES_DESC:0 "Thanks to the shrewd policies of the former President Debs, not only did America manage to stay out of the mess that was the Great War, but it also was the mediator of the resulting peace. Now, despite those efforts, the fraying concert of Europe threatens to disturb the burgeoning republic once again. The coming storm may be one that the country cannot avoid. Though the wounds of the depression are still fresh, many Americans feel that the worst is behind them. They revere Norman Thomas, the 'modern day Debs', and his socialist party. Only time will tell if their loyalty to the president is deserved."

 USA_country_intro_desc_1:0 "At the turn of the century, the §3United States of America§! was in the throes of a great war. There was no declaration of hostilities, there were no armies, yet it was a war all the same. On one side, the forces of capital. On the other, the forces of labor. This was the §YGreat Class War§!, raging since the dawn of time. \n\nFollowing a recent string of victories for capital, the §7Republican§! candidate §YWilliam McKinley§! ascended to the presidency on March 4th, 1897, and would serve as president until the completion of his second term on March 4th, 1905. His administration was a typical one; he furthered American Imperialism abroad, and furthered the interests of the upper class at home. The position of capital was secure.\n\nYet there was one who would stand against them. The §RSocialist Party of America§! would speak for the worker, who had no voice of his own."
 USA_country_intro_desc_2:0 "The Winner-Take-All electoral system of the §3United States§! has long meant that two parties dominate the country's politics, from the local level up to the national. Once a party has secured the presidency even once, their electoral fortunes are assured for the foreseeable future.\n\nFor the better part of a century, the §3Democratic§! and §7Republican§! parties used this fact to their advantage. Both were capitalist in flavor; although the specifics varied by date and party, it was known that neither would ever become friendly to socialists in their ranks, making, at best meaningless concessions to the working class.\n\nIt was long assumed that the system's strength lay in its rigidity; the fact that a party must win the presidency to be taken seriously on the national level would forever protect them from meaningful competition.\n\nWhat they failed to count on was the growing anger of the American people."
 USA_country_intro_desc_3:0 "The 1912 election changed everything. In an instant, a deadly blow was struck against the forces of capital, and §YEugene Victor Debs§! was elected the 29th president of the §3United States§!.\n\nBut the battle was not over yet. The forces of labor would have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of political ground ahead of them."
