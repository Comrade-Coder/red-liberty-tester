 ### FOCUS TREE ###
 USA_the_thomas_admin:0 "The Thomas Administration"
 USA_the_thomas_admin_desc:0 "Many doubted that a socialist such as Thomas could ever gain ground in America, even with the extraordinary circumstances that led to Eugene V. Debs' premiership in office. But with the failure of the Hoover administration to tackle the depression, and as Thomas put it best; "lack of a backbone to stand up to wallstreet", Americans flocked to vote for change, and change they shall recieve."
 USA_the_thomas_admin_tt:0 "We will pass the §YEmergency Banking Relief Act§!."
 USA_unity_above_all_else:0 "Unity Above All Else"
 USA_unity_above_all_else_desc:0 "As we become well-entrenched in the nation's power structures we must resist the urge to get in bed with the bourgeoisie elements of the government. There can be no compromise with the capitalist politicians across the aisle! Unless we strike while the iron is hot our struggle will have been for nothing; the unity of the party must be preserved, compromise be damned!"
 USA_reach_across:0 "Reach Across the Aisle"
 USA_reach_across_desc:0 "While it may alienate some of the radical elements in our party and voting base, it would be wise to seek compromise with the capitalists where we can. America is in a delicate situation at the moment, and we shouldn't be making it any worse by throwing our weight around carelessly. We won't be abandoning the revolution, of course, but it would be wise to feel around for any possible allies outside of our party."

 USA_preparing_our_agenda_desc:0 "We've won the hearts and minds of the voters with our slogans and ideas, but now comes the task of codifying everything we said into a slate of proper policy proposals, a task which is easier said than done. We made a lot of promises, and some of them may be a bit contradictory; we wooed moderates by proposing laws that would hold banks accountable, and we wooed radicals by promising to nationalize all the banks. We must tread delicately..."

 USA_of_industry_desc:0 "Economically, America has only just begun to recover from the Great Depression. The manufacturing industry has been stripped to its bare bones, with many workers having their hours slashed by factory owners.

Even seemingly minor accidents with heavy equipment can maim someone so severely that they can no longer support their family. Not to mention the countless lives wasted due to the complete lack of safety procedures. The only option we have is radical safety regulation. A new government agency must be made in order to scrutinise and overhaul every safety regulation. Even the death of one American worker due to poor working conditions is a tragedy.

 USA_of_agriculture_desc:0 "The agricultural sector of the American economy has, to say the least, had a pretty poor go of it for the last decade. The worst of it has been the Dust Bowl, which has thus far killed nearly seven thousand people, and caused hundreds of thousands more to flee from their homes in the prairies. It is time for the President to focus on solving the issues plaguing our farming class."
 USA_federal_relief_programs:0 "Agricultural Relief Programs"
 USA_federal_relief_programs_desc:0 "One of the hardest affected groups of workers affected by the depression are the ones that supply the hearts and stomachs of Americans, the humble farmer. This is in due part to the anarchic nature of the crop markets, whereby surplus grains and wheats are produced due to overcalculations by bourgeouise bulk buying and in turn failing to sell the produce to their customers, hurting more so the bottom line of these small scale farmers.\n\nUnder the directive of Henry A. Wallace, Secretary of Agriculture, and his dream child, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, we shall promote more essential crops that are being underproduced, incentivizing farmers not to follow the market, but rather the food needs of the people at large, with the government helping them to subsidize these less profitable crops in the short term."

This has been a disaster for the region, which almost solely relies on agriculture. Scientists have come up with many ideas to stop the growth of this desert, and even possibly shrink it. It is suspected that if we plant trees on the perimeter of the afflicted regions it will ensure dust storms do not occur as often. We can also educate farmers on more sustainable ways to cultivate their crops, such as strip farming and crop rotation. With this new plan we can hopefully cut our losses and bring back Middle America’s agriculture, better and stronger than before."

Since the beginning of the Great Depression we have had two main issues. The first is that too many people are unemployed. Two, we lack the manpower to engage in large-scale public works. The solution is simple; we get young, unemployed men willing to work and offer them a deal they cannot refuse. In exchange for three hot meals a day, free room and board and twenty five dollars monthly to their families, we only ask them to help us in our endeavor to improve America. They will be tasked with building bridges, dams, roads, and any other works this country asks of them. Their most important task, however, shall be their construction of a great tree wall, our mighty to contain the Dustbowl."

So, the reasoning goes, we must strengthen the executive branch. Now it must be made clear not just to the public but also to members of our party that this is not some power-grab by President Thomas; we've learned valuable lessons from the Russians, and we shall not repeat Lenin's mistake of centralizing too much power in too few people. Once the revolution is complete, we shall set things back to their normal course, and a true, socialist democracy shall reign.

It's not even their place to decide what is and isn't constitutional; they gave themselves that power! Who even are the lawmakers around here anyway?! The people have chosen us; have chosen our vision! Nothing will stop us now, not even the court! Their legitimacy dried up long ago, and our voters would never forgive us if we stopped now. The path ahead is clear: Stack the court with an unassailable socialist majority, change a few names on our bills and executive orders, and send them through again to get approval. This is simpler than it sounds; we don't even need to create too many new seats; just accuse a few of the more questionable justices of treason, bribery, or some high crime or misdemeanor, and replace them promptly.

Work is everything; it is how one gains the respect of one’s peers and the money to put food on the table and a roof overhead. That work itself is commodified under capitalism is absurd. It guarantees an underclass that cannot take care of itself; a desperate mass that can be used as a reserve army of labor; should the workers strike, they can be fired and replaced by this desperate underclass. Work is not simply a matter of dignity or wellbeing; it is a matter of power. We shall strive to enshrine a right to work in American law, to ensure that any worker may find meaningful, gainful employment building roads or dams or schools across our great nation. Where there is no underclass, no reserve army of labor, capital will have no choice but to bow to the demands of a united working class!"

 USA_the_naval_act_desc:0 "A proud American tradition, almost as much so as thanksgiving turkey, the naval acts have been a way to conduct state observed naval projects, assigning such contracts to private initiative, which have proven to bore fruit time and time again.\n\nIf we are to revolutionize the navy for the upcoming conflict, a new Naval Act will be paramount in securing our global dominance at home and abroad."
 USA_north_carolina_class:0 "North Carolina Class"
 USA_north_carolina_class_desc:0 "Designed to be both formidable and flexible on the ocean plain, the North Carolina class is the latest in top tier fast battleships, capable of shooting down not just enemy warships, but also the predators of war in the air, using an impressive 16 in/45 caliber Mark 6 gun, with three gun turrets mounted on the centerline.\n\nIf any enemy is to try and outflank our main fleets, they will surely have to contend in fear this behemoth, or rather nimble, beast of a ship."
 USA_south_dakota_class:0 "South Dakota Class"
 USA_south_dakota_class_desc:0 "First being constructed following the Great War, this class of battleships were made with keeping in mind both modern design principles of heavy and yet seemingly weightless tonnage, and durability against increasing firepower, this class of ships is both tough and mighty, with a ship hull that, whilst heavy and perhaps seen as contradictory to the design principles of the North Carolina Class, still serves its place as a heavy fire power machine, capable of resisting leakages and potential hull damage, with an even more powerful 16 inch gun, with any ship being caught in the cross fires surely to pay for their error."
 USA_two_ocean_navy:0 "Two-Ocean Navy Act"
 USA_two_ocean_navy_desc:0 "From sea to shining sea, our navy must be able to project its power across the two continent sized oceans, with the objective of this new reinvigorated Navy to be able to fulfill this duty without imperfection, for enemies from the Pacific such as the Japanese and their modernising naval armada threatening the largely assumed naval dominance of the US and the Germans in the Atlantic, with the horrid memories of the sinking of the Lusitania still fresh in the hearts of Americans, with this proclamation, we will guarantee continued supremacy on the high seas for the destined future conflict."
 
 USA_matching_europe:0 "Matching the Fleets of Europe"
 USA_matching_europe_desc:0 "The United States of America finds itself in a unique situation, forced to maintain naval supremacy within two separate oceans - projecting power from the coasts of China to Ireland. It becomes more necessary every day that the United States maintains a fleet of similar, if not larger, stature than that of their European counterparts should the situation ever arise where they are needed."
 USA_pacific_presence:0 "Pacific Presience"
 USA_pacific_presence_desc:0 "To ensure the safety and security of our Asiatic possessions, including that of both the Philippine Islands, Hawaii and our various Pacific Bases it is of the utmost importance that we maintain a fleet directly capable of combating any adversary we may face in the Pacific - whether it be China, the Pacific or a European Power and their colonial possessions."
 USA_atlantic_awareness:0 "Atlantic Awareness"
 USA_atlantic_awareness_desc:0 "Traditionally the domain of our European counterparts, and more recently a battleground between the Allied and Central Powers - the Atlantic Ocean holds as one of our most vital flanks in any conflict that may arise. In uncertain times such as these, it doesn’t hurt to remain vigilant within our own front yard."
 USA_study_super_heavy_designs:0 "Study Super-Heavy Designs"
 USA_study_super_heavy_designs_desc:0 "Innovations in Naval technology have been vast and numerous within the last generation and especially so following the Great War. As of yet, the United States has remained positively ancient in terms of our naval presence - but the time has come to modernize and push ourselves to par with the great European naval powers."
 USA_iowa_class:0 "Iowa Class"
 USA_iowa_class_desc:0 "The Iowa Class Super-Heavy Battleship will be our answer to the question of our Atlantic Naval Doctrine, a ship both impenetrable and with the firepower to boot. Estimated by the War Department to be superior to any model currently in production by the British or the Germans, it is a certain upper hand in any near conflict. They say Britannia Rules the Waves, but it’s of little doubt that soon the Yanks shall soon be in command."
 
 USA_expand_operations:0 "Expand Shipbuilding Facilities"
 USA_expand_operations_desc:0 "There are often two schools of thought when it comes to military strategy; Quality vs Quantity - but American Minds have decided on a much simpler third alternative; Both. We will push the output of high-quality naval assets to both outnumber and outmatch our foes!"
 USA_modern_screens:0 "Modern Screening"
 USA_modern_screens_desc:0 "A fleet of nothing but Capital Ships, although admittedly would be perhaps one of the coolest additions to the United States Armed Forces in decades - would also be a disaster; hence why we will soon begin the addition of Modern Screening to our fleets. Destroyers, Cruisers, technological advancement and many other innovations are to be made commonplace to guarantee the protection of our Heavy assets."
