 ARG_british_monopoly:0 "British Monopoly"
 ARG_british_monopoly_desc:0 "Following British reapproachment after the financial slump that impacted our over-reliant export based economy, the Roca-Runciman Agreement was supposed to guarantee British investment and trade with our markets. However, this has had unintentional consequences on our domestic industries, making us even more dependent on British loans to finance our bleeding coffers. Whilst many in our cabinet have vested interests in keeping this shaky balance of power in place due to financial incentives, we musn't let this bite us in the near future, and drafting contingency plans, as well as potentially taking a stance against the british magnates would send a sound message: business for the Argentinean working man, not the British usurper!"
 ARG_crippled_industry:0 "Crippled Industry"
 ARG_crippled_industry_desc:0 "Although we are famed for many things, industrial capacity is not one of them, largely thanks to the complacency of the aristocrats in Buenos Aires, who during the 19th and early 20th centuries did not view the need to expand industries when cattle farms and plantations were innumerably profitable. This fact has become more and more apparent as the world economy begins to depend less on these meager returns. If we wish to remain the prime exporter of Latin America, we must shift attention to raw material goods, and to diversify our primary sector, with mass scale drives in industrial commerce to modernise Argentina, truly bringing us into the 20th century"
 ARG_brazilian_immigrants:0 "Brazilian Refugees"
 ARG_brazilian_immigrants_desc:0 "With the policies  of the Argentine state always having been attractive to foreign migrant workers, this has also attracted one of the main rivals in our vicinity, with Brazilian business men and financiers alike especially viewing Argentina as a safe haven for them. As Brazil is itself engulfed in its own civil conflict, the regions of Misiones and Corrientes, both once competed over by Paraguayan revanchists, who both we and the Brazilians thwarted, now stands as the go-to hub for the incoming Brazilian diaspora. Perhaps we can use this to our advantage, by appropriating their skills for the improvement of these hinterlands to be entrepenural power houses."
 
 POLITICS_AGUSTIN_PEDRO_DESC:0 "Agustín Pedro Justo Rolón is regarded by numerous titles: the conservative statesman, the kingpin, and the generalissmo of the Argentine Confederation, he has divided opinions, being viewed by the conservative and religious of the nation as the saviour from continued socially liberal policies that had been widely seen as threatening the established order, with liberal circles seeing him as a modern tyrannos.\n\nWhatever may be the opinion of this ambitious man, his political manouvering has seen him balance both Argentine and foreign interests, securing favourable deals with the British, and promoting public works projects to combat the increasing ailements of the global economy impacting the state, coupled with his links within the military, means that his reign, for the most part, remains as steafast as the people that which he now governs, hoping to bring Argentina to a modern and hardened state, with a strong executive and even stronger military arm to guide it."
