 baku.1.desc:0 "With the demand for oil only growing larger as Europe begins to re-mobilize conditions in the oil feilds of Baku have only grown worse. Starting with longer hours with little pay increae the conditions soon began to decline at an incredible rate as the bosses atempted to push out as much oil as quickly as possible. Seeing the worsening conditions the pro soviet AKP formed the Emergancy Baku Union Strike Committee or TBBTK to organize the oil workers in Baku. This began a red tide across the city of Baku from the organizing oil workers to almost every other industry. Unsuprisingly the bosses didn't take this well and backed by the Azerbaijani military began a harsh union busting campagin only for it to come crashing down when the military opened fire on 4 union organizers killing them causing an uproar across the city. With in days of the organizer's deaths the call was put out for a strike, which quickly spread to a general strike shuting down the city. With the city striking the government was forced to move to Ganja to adress the worsening crisis. But now with Baku in crisis and the oil no longer flowing it presents a unique opertunity for the surrounding nations to take advantage of this crisis."

 baku.2.title:0 "An Oppertunity Has Come"
 baku.2.desc:0 "A unique oppertunity has arisen that could prove quite benifical if we act soon. A series of events have unfolded which led to a general strike in Baku shutting down the oil fields causing immense loss for Azerbaijani profits every day the strike continues, which has lead to a military response to atempt to crush the stike. Using the fact that the strike is led by the pro Soviet AKP and that the military is pre-occupied it could be the perfect time to strike at the border and help bring the revolution to the workers in Baku."

 baku.3.title:0 "Soviets Intervene in Azerbaijan"
 baku.3.desc:0 "With Baku struck by a general strike led by the Azerbaijani Communist Party the AKP the Soivets have decided in a controversal move to spread the revolution, using the strike in Baku as an excuse. An expiditionary force was established and is now attacking on the border with Azerbaijan with hopes of crusing the defending troops and pushing to Baku. Should the Soviets win their attack it is almost certian that Azerbaijan will soon after fall to either civil war or to the revolution, but should the Azeri defenders win it would be a great humilation to the Soviets and shut down their hopes of expansion into the Caucasus."

 baku.4.title:0 "Azerbaijan Resists Red Army Attack"
 baku.4.desc:0 "What many thought to be immpossible has become reality as the once thought hopeless defense of Azerbaijan has pushed back against the Red Army and defended their borders. With the defeat at the border the Soviets soon after backed off leaving the AKP without a strong ally. Allthough the Soviets have backed off in their support for the AKP and the strikers it doesn't mean they are without hope as the city is controlled by the AKP in the so called 'Baku Soviet Republic'."
 baku.4.a:0 "Quite a Suprise"
 baku.5.title:0 "Red Army Occupies Baku"
 baku.5.desc:0 "The many expected would happen has, and the Red Army has defeated the Azerbaijani army and pushed to Baku to aid the AKP and the strikers in the city. With Baku now firmly under Soviet control any hope of regaining the city is quickly diminishing. The new Soviet rulers quickly established a still 'independant' Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan to give legitamicy to the Soviet occupation. Now the question remains on whether the Soviet troops will turn west and march into the rest of the nation."

Troops originally stationed in Mughan have been advancing throughout the country, and many believe that Iran, despite stating it has good intentions, is only doing this for their own good. Many believe Azerbaijan may become a puppet of Iran, or even annexed entirely. Azerbaijan stated they will not welcome the Iranian aggressors and will fight to the last man."
