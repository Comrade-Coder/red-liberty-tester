 POLITICS_FELIPE_CARILLO_PUERTO_DESC:0 "Felipe Carrillo Puerto is a notable Mexican revolutionary and political figure who played a crucial role in the early 20th-century struggles for social justice, agrarian reform, and indigenous rights. Born in Motul, Yucatán, Carrillo Puerto became a prominent advocate for the rights of the Maya people in the Yucatán Peninsula. \n\nCarrillo Puerto's political career gained momentum during the Mexican Revolution, and he aligned himself with the revolutionary forces fighting for transformative change. His commitment to social justice and indigenous rights led him to join the ranks of the Socialist Workers' Party. \n\nA key aspect of Carrillo Puerto's legacy is his role in the implementation of land reform in the Yucatán. He serves as the governor of Yucatán from 1922 to today, and during his tenure, he has worked to redistribute land to indigenous communities and promote education and social programs."
