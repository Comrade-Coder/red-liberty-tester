 POLITICS_JUAN_NEPOMUCENO_GUERRA_DESC:0 "In the early 20th century, Mexico experienced significant political and social upheaval, including the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). This period, which led crime to soar, was one of many reasons why Guerra became involved in various aspects of local politics and power struggles. His keen understanding of the region and its dynamics allowed him to navigate the complexities of the era. \n\nGuerra's influence extended beyond political maneuvering. By the early-1930s, he began to play a role in the burgeoning illicit activities that would later be associated with organized crime. His involvement in smuggling operations along the U.S.-Mexico border laid the foundation for a criminal empire that would continue to evolve in the years to come. \n\nAs of 1937, Juan Nepomuceno Guerra had established himself as a key player in the illicit trade networks that operated between Mexico and the United States, controlling all contraband that went past the Rio Grande. The economic opportunities presented by smuggling fueled the growth of Guerra's influence."
