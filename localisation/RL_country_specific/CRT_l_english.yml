 POLITICS_ENRIQUE_GOROSTIETA_DESC:0 "A man of clandestine ambitions, and yet one of the most feared and respected men of the Catholic opposition to the Mexican government forces, Enrique Gorostieta is a man with many rumored connections and reasons for his opposition to the government. Having been born as the grandson of a minister serving under the seven term long regime of Porfirio Díaz, his ambitions led him to serve in the army, and battle key figures such as Zapata and Pascual Orozco after the collapse of the government in 1911, before being forced to emigrate after the victory of the revolutionaries. Many claim to have seen him serving in the French Foreign Legion, though just as many dispute this claim, saying he remained in Texas, before returning to Mexico, either as a businessman, a soap manufacturer, a lone ranger, you name it.\n\nThe rabbit hole doesn't stop there, with the now leading general clearly professing his anti-clerical stance towards the Catholic Church and it's dominance in Mexican politics, yet when the call of the Cristeros to fight against the oppressive and sectarian Calles Law was proclaimed, he swiftly cast away these previously held beliefs in order to fight the cause of the Cristeros. Whether it was due to his wife's support of them, being bribed to fight for them, or perhaps his opposition to the harshness of the Calles Law even with his anti-clerical positions, is unclear.\n\nWhat is decidedly not unclear, however, is his military prowess, scoring multiple victories against the Mexican government, carving up a fiefdom in the south with broad support across the country, and being named as the official leader of the Cristeros by National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty. Many venerate his prowess in the battlefield, even if the man's past and reasons for serving for the cause remain unknown to his followers, and they will serve and die for him as though he were the second coming of Christ."

 CRT_in_defense_of_the_lord_desc:0 "All around us, our beloved Mexico has fallen into decadence and atheistic degeneracy, as millions of Catholics across the nation are oppressed under the current revolutionary government that has upended the cultural traditions and customs that the Catholic Church has fostered within the nation, seeking to usurp any semblance of love and kinship between God's children, only to leave the residual sum of sin at the behests of Satan himself.\n\nUnder the leadership of the now converted Enrique, his tactical genius has marooned much of the government forces in the southern cone of the country, gathering a large contingent of support from the rural and middling working class. With the broad appeal to end the Calles laws that have persecuted the right to worship our lord and saviour, our armies have seen some of the highest displays of moral in the conflict, even if foreign backers are reluctant to support the will of God and of their people."
