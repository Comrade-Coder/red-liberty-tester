 AHE_incompetent_military:0 "Incompetent Military"
 AHE_incompetent_military_desc:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire has struggled for decades with military preparedness, our tactics remain in the era of Napoleon rather than the modern day - worse even is our officer corps, in which oftentimes those with rank to hold charge, do not command men that can understand their language. Strict centralisation and reform must be enacted before we can call ourselves a military power once again."

Purges and a focus on anti-corruption are all that can solve this mess of an issue."
