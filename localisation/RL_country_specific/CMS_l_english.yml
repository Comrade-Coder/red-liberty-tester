 POLITICS_NICOLAS_RODRIGUEZ_CARRASCO_DESC:0 "Nicolás Rodríguez Carrasco emerges as a multifaceted figure in Mexican history, notably as a general, revolutionary, and the architect behind the creation of the Revolutionary Mexicanist Action, more commonly recognized as the Gold Shirts. \n\nSpanning his lifetime, Rodríguez Carrasco actively participated in various uprisings against Mexican governments. By the 1930s, his ideological inclinations underwent a notable shift, drawing inspiration from the German Fatherland Party. As an avowed admirer of the German far-right, Rodríguez Carrasco channeled his convictions through the Gold Shirts, a fascist paramilitary organization. Under his leadership, this group fervently campaigned for the expulsion of Jews, Chinese, and communists from Mexican soil."

 CMS_the_new_revolution_desc:0 "Our people have been under the boot of communists for too long! This is the perfect time to create a perfect Mexico! A country free of communism, free of treasonists and free of weaklings, one under the great direction of the Revolutionary Mexicanist Action!"
 CMS_la_reclamacion:0 "La Reclamación"
 CMS_la_reclamacion_desc:0 "My fellow compadres, our cherished land has endured the suffocating embrace of degenerate communism for an intolerable stretch of time. The insidious grip of this destructive and ungodly ideology has inflicted grievous harm upon our great Mexico, sowing seeds of moral decay and societal degeneracy. "La Reclamación" stands as our bold and righteous endeavor, our clarion call to liberate our beloved nation from the suffocating clutches of this odious doctrine, and to regain our rightful territories in the southwestern United States, which have been tragically tainted by the presence of those communist swines.\n\nBut it is not just the land that we seek to reclaim; it is the freedom of our Mexican brethren who have suffered under the oppressive rule of these communist swines in the United States. Our mission in "La Reclamación" is two-fold: to free our ancestral territories from the moral degradation of communism and to rescue our Mexican compatriots from the chains of oppression."
