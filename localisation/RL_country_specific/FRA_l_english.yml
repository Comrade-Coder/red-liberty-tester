 FRA_maurice_thorez:0 "Maurice Thorez"
 POLITICS_MAURICE_THOREZ_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was a French politician who rose to become a leader of the Jacobin faction within the Communist Party of France in the 1930s. Thorez advocated for a more orthodox Marxist-Leninist path for French communism, which appealed to many party members who believed in strict adherence to Soviet policies.\n\nAs the head of the Jacobin faction, Thorez was able to attract a significant number of supporters within the PCF, positioning the party as a formidable political force in France. He was known for his careful and pragmatic approach to politics, demonstrating a willingness to work within the constraints of the existing political system. Thorez was also a skilled negotiator and played a pivotal role in establishing alliances between the PCF and other left-wing parties.\n\nFollowing the Putsch, Thorez stands as the leader of traditional Marxist-Leninist Communists, opposing Doriot's National Communism as an affront to both Marx and Lenin."

Doriot advocated for a more nationalist and militant path for French communism, which appealed to many young communists disillusioned with the PCF's leadership and Soviet policies.\n\nAs the leader of the National Communism faction, Doriot was able to rally a significant following within the PCF, positioning the party as a force in French politics. Despite his controversial views, he was a skilled orator who could deliver fiery speeches and mobilize support from the working class. However, his growing popularity also drew the attention of the PCF's leadership, who viewed him as a potential threat to their authority.\n\nOverall, Jacques Doriot played a key role in shaping the PCF's ideology and strategy in the tumultuous years leading up to World War II, and his leadership of the National Communism faction had a significant impact on the French left's evolution."

 ### IDEAS ###
 FRA_revanchisme:0 "French Revanchism"
 FRA_revanchisme_desc:0 "After the Great War, the French Revanchist ideology gained momentum as a response to the perceived injustice of Alsace-Lorraine remaining under German control. It was fueled by the sense of humiliation and territorial loss suffered by France during both the Franco-Prussian War and the Great War. Revanchists argued that Alsace-Lorraine, with its historical and cultural ties to France, should rightfully be returned to French sovereignty.\n\nFrench Revanchists believed that the loss of Alsace-Lorraine was a violation of France's territorial integrity and national pride. They sought to rectify this perceived injustice through diplomatic means, political pressure, and, in some cases, by advocating for military action. The revanchist sentiment is particularly strong among nationalist and conservative circles, who see the return of Alsace-Lorraine as crucial to restoring France's status as a major European power."
 
 FRA_fallen_govt:0 "Fallen Government"
 FRA_fallen_govt_desc:0 "Until a complete restructure of the Government, or a total return of public trust in the democratic process can be restored there is little to no hope of any governing body taking full control anytime soon. The nation itself is currently being governed by Regional Councils and Municipal Governments leading to great amounts of autonomy and little to no federal overlook - military structures and the electoral process hold strong regardless of the nation lacking a federal government."

If not dealt with carefully, these leagues may very well just take hold of France and guide it in a very unsavoury direction."
 
 FRA_pop_crisis_1:0 "Population Crisis"
 FRA_pop_crisis_1_desc:0 "Following World War I, France experienced a severe population crisis as a result of the immense loss of lives during the conflict. The war had claimed the lives of a large number of French soldiers, leaving behind a significant demographic imbalance. The loss of the younger generation, which was heavily impacted by the war, created a substantial gap in the labor force and posed significant challenges to post-war reconstruction efforts.\n\nThe population crisis has wide-ranging effects on various aspects of French society. It has led to labor shortages in key industries and sectors, hindering the nation's ability to rebuild its infrastructure and jumpstart the economy. Additionally, the reduced population means a decline in consumer demand, which further impedes economic growth and recovery."

Efforts such as encouraging the return of demobilized soldiers, promoting immigration, and implementing policies to support population growth have begun to rectify the demographic imbalances. These measures show promise in alleviating labor shortages and revitalizing the economy."
 FRA_pop_crisis_3_desc:0 "Following World War I, France experienced a severe population crisis as a result of the immense loss of lives during the conflict. The war had claimed the lives of a large number of French soldiers, leaving behind a significant demographic imbalance. The loss of the younger generation, which was heavily impacted by the war, created a substantial gap in the labor force and posed significant challenges to post-war reconstruction efforts.\n\nWith determined government measures and effective interventions, France successfully overcame the population crisis that followed World War I. Through initiatives aimed at revitalizing the workforce, promoting immigration, and supporting population growth, the nation has corrected the demographic imbalances. Labor shortages have been alleviated, and the economy is on a path of recovery and stability. The population crisis is now a chapter in France's history, testament to the resilience and proactive measures of the government."

This trend appears to persist under the newly formed Popular Front government, a sentiment shared by moderates and radicals alike, as echoed in widespread protests. Moderates within the government voice concerns over the Popular Front's perceived lack of substantial efforts to enhance the lives of ordinary citizens. Issues such as persistent inflation and stark disparities in quality of life across the nation underscore their apprehensions.\n\nSimultaneously, leftist radicals criticize the Popular Front for what they perceive as a failure to promptly implement the necessary reforms to propel the nation forward. The French Republic, seemingly crippled by these internal conflicts, finds itself lagging behind neighboring nations that forge ahead into the future.

United in their fervent opposition to the socialist government, this formidable alliance has now issued a resounding call for a widespread uprising.\n\nMaurras, an eloquent orator, impassionedly addresses the masses, weaving a narrative that paints the socialist administration as a threat to the very essence of French identity. The banners of the Patriotic Front flutter with nationalist slogans, as fiery speeches resonate through the air, rallying supporters for a collective action against what they perceive as an existential threat.\n\nAs the call for an uprising gains momentum, the future of France hangs in the balance.

The whispers of his potential allegiance to the monarchists have fueled speculation and now, with his symbolic entry into the Patriotic Front, the political landscape in France undergoes a seismic shift.\n\nThe charismatic de Gaulle, a military luminary, steps onto the stage as a key player in the unfolding drama. His decision to align with the Patriotic Front sends shockwaves through the political establishment, adding both gravitas and military prowess to the cause. The suspicions surrounding his monarchist leanings only intensify the intrigue surrounding the burgeoning alliance.\n\nIn the bustling streets and crowded cafes, citizens murmur in hushed tones about the significance of de Gaulle's defection. The Patriotic Front gains momentum as its ranks swell with supporters emboldened by the inclusion of a military figure of de Gaulle's stature. The air is charged with anticipation as the nation watches, waiting to see how this unexpected alliance will shape the course of French history.

By disbanding the current government, he aims to cast doubt on the efficacy of the Patriotic Front, painting it as a disruptive force that threatens the nation's stability.\n\nThe announcement sends shockwaves through the corridors of power and reverberates across the nation. The political atmosphere becomes charged with anticipation and speculation as citizens grapple with the implications of this sudden dissolution. The impending elections promise to be a pivotal moment in French politics, a battleground where the ideologies of the Popular Front and the emerging Patriotic Front will clash.\n\nAs the nation braces for the electoral contest, the streets buzz with debates, discussions, and the palpable tension of political uncertainty.

Accusations of election interference and rigging cast a shadow over the democratic process, fueling the discontent among leftists who perceive this outcome as a grave threat to French democracy.\n\nThe air is thick with tension as demonstrators flood the boulevards, waving banners denouncing the alleged electoral manipulation. Chants demanding transparency, fair elections, and an investigation into the voting irregularities echo throughout the nation. The protesters, fueled by a sense of injustice, converge in public squares, staging sit-ins, and organizing rallies to voice their opposition to what they see as a subversion of the democratic principles they hold dear.\n\nAs the protests escalate, clashes with law enforcement become inevitable, turning some areas into scenes of chaos and unrest. The belief that the very essence of French democracy is at stake fuels the fervor of the demonstrators, who demand accountability from the newly elected government and call for an independent inquiry into the alleged election interference.\n\nThe international community watches with concern as France grapples with internal strife, and the outcome of the 1936 election continues to sow seeds of division and uncertainty. The streets become a battleground not only for political ideologies but also for the future trajectory of French governance.

The protests, initially scattered, now seamlessly coalesce into an influential general strike, serving as a continuation of the narrative of discontent that has swept across the nation.\n\nUnited by a shared sense of injustice, workers from diverse industries join the chorus of dissent, amplifying their demands for fair wages, improved working conditions, and the recognition of workers' unions. The leaders, emerging organically from the ranks of various trade unions and workers' associations, step forward to articulate the collective grievances that extend beyond the electoral arena.\n\nAs the general strike gains momentum, the disruptions to daily life become more pronounced. Major industrial centers and business districts, already echoing with the fervor of protests, now witness a complete halt in production, amplifying the impact of the workers' movement. The demands for systemic changes resonate not only in the streets but also in the broader context of the contested election results that have fueled this widespread discontent.\n\nThe streets, still bearing the marks of the recent protests, now host a new chapter in the struggle for a more just and equitable society. Banners, placards, and chants that once rallied against alleged election irregularities now converge with the rallying cries for workers' rights. The momentum of the general strike becomes a forceful current pushing against the status quo, challenging the very foundations of the existing order.\n\nThe government, navigating the turbulent waters of public discontent, is now confronted not only with the aftermath of a contested election but also with the resolute demands of a united workforce. The fate of French democracy hangs in the balance, and the government's response to this dynamic and evolving situation will shape the trajectory of the nation."

The frustrated strikers, feeling neglected and unheard, escalate their actions. The initial calls for change now echo in the streets, mingling with a growing sense of discontent.\n\nThe government's inertia serves as a catalyst, transforming the collective demand for workers' rights into a broader manifestation of dissatisfaction with the ruling authorities. The frustration simmers and erupts into open clashes between the protesters and the police. The strikes, once a plea for change, now become a focal point for a broader societal outcry against perceived injustices.\n\nAs the confrontations intensify, tear gas clouds the air, and the clashes become more heated. The streets, once a stage for peaceful demonstrations, now bear witness to the collision of opposing forces. The government's failure to address the grievances of the workers becomes a rallying point for broader dissent, pushing the nation toward a tumultuous crossroads.\n\nThe cycle of violence accelerates, underscoring the government's inadequacy and deepening the uncertainty surrounding the future of French democracy. The fate of the nation now hangs in the balance, with each clash in the streets shaping the narrative of a discontented populace and an unresponsive government."

 france.16.title:0 "A Red Summer"
 france.16.desc:0 "In the wake of the government's dismissive response to the general strike, a radical shift occurs within the ranks of the communists. Frustrated by the authorities' refusal to address socialistic demands and the crackdown on civil unrest, the rhetoric takes a more militant turn.\n\nCommunist leaders openly call for revolution, asserting that the time for peaceful reform has passed. A growing faction within the movement embraces the idea of armed resistance, viewing it as the only means to secure the changes they seek. Their discontent transforms into action as they mobilize to arm themselves.\n\nIn a series of audacious moves, communist activists raid armories, seizing weapons and ammunition. The once-peaceful calls for workers' reforms now echo with revolutionary fervor. The government's failure to engage in meaningful dialogue and its harsh response to dissent serve as a rallying cry for those who see armed resistance as the last resort.\n\nThe nation teeters on the precipice as these radicalized communists, now armed and emboldened, pose a significant challenge to the established order. The stage is set for a confrontation that will test the resilience of the government and the depth of the discontent that has gripped the nation."

 france.17.title:0 "The Center-left Folds"
 france.17.desc:0 "In a dramatic turn of events, the SFIO, a key component of the government coalition, announces its departure from the ruling alliance. The once-stable political landscape of France crumbles further as the SFIO declares the government illegitimate, aligning itself with the growing revolutionary fervor sweeping the nation.\n\nCiting the government's failure to address the legitimate concerns of the working class and its heavy-handed response to civil unrest, SFIO leaders make a public proclamation severing ties with the ruling coalition. In a bold and unprecedented move, they throw their support behind the communist revolutionaries, viewing them as the rightful champions of the people's aspirations.\n\nThis abrupt shift in allegiance sends shockwaves through political circles, leaving the government coalition in disarray. The SFIO's decision amplifies the perception of a fractured and weakened government, fueling the flames of discontent already burning across the nation. The stage is now set for a more formidable opposition against the authorities, as the communists and their newfound allies pose a united front against the struggling government.\n\nAs the sun sets on the old political alliances, the specter of civil war looms larger, casting a shadow over the future of France. The choices made in the coming days will shape the destiny of the nation, and the echoes of this momentous shift will reverberate throughout its history."

 france.18.desc_life:0 "In a chilling turn of events, an attempted assassination unfolds during one of Francois de la Rocque's impassioned speeches. As the charismatic leader addresses a crowd, fervently expressing his vision for the future of France, chaos erupts when a lone communist, motivated by political fervor, fires a shot in an attempt to silence the far-right figurehead.\n\nThe crack of the gunshot pierces the air, and chaos ensues as the projectile narrowly misses its target. Swift and courageous action by security forces ensures that de la Rocque remains unharmed, his life spared by a matter of inches. The would-be assassin is quickly subdued, seized by authorities before they can wreak further havoc.\n\nThe incident sends shockwaves through the political landscape, intensifying the already heightened tensions between the far-right and leftist factions. Authorities swiftly denounce the act of violence, emphasizing the importance of democratic discourse and condemning any attempts to stifle political expression through force.\n\nDespite the close call, de la Rocque emerges from the ordeal unscathed, and his resolve appears unshaken. The failed assassination attempt serves as a stark reminder of the volatile atmosphere gripping France, where ideological clashes threaten to escalate into more sinister acts. As the nation holds its breath, the specter of political violence casts a long shadow over its uncertain future."

The immediate aftermath is marked by chaos and uncertainty, as authorities scramble to investigate the heinous act and its implications for the already tense political climate.\n\nIn the absence of de la Rocque, the leadership succession within the far-right remains unclear. The movement, now grappling with the loss of its charismatic figurehead, faces internal challenges as factions vie for control and attempt to steer the course in the wake of this devastating blow.\n\nThe nation watches with bated breath as the consequences of this violent act unfold, uncertain of the impact it will have on the broader political landscape. The assassination of de la Rocque casts a long shadow over the future of French politics, leaving both far-right supporters and adversaries grappling with the aftermath of this tragic and tumultuous event."

 ### FAR RIGHT EVENTS ###
 
 france_far_right.1.desc:0 "After over sixty years of Republican rule and the effective disappearance of overt monarchism in the French political scene, it was thought that its return was impossible. That belief was mistaken.\n\nToday, members of the Action Française entered the largely-vacant Palais du Luxembourg and Palais Bourbon, allowed entry by their comrades who already had seats in the government, and declared themselves as being the new government of France by virtue of simply occupying the halls of government.\n\nThe military seems onboard, although a vocal minority of the population is less than enthused by this turn of events, and of course virtually all of the republicans parties have declared the new regime illegitimate, to which leaders of Action Française have snidely remarked that, if they loved their republic so much, perhaps they should not have abandoned it by resigning their posts.\n\nThe leader of Action Française, Charles Maurras, has been declared regent in a ceremony that blended both ancient themes with modern political language, evoking the glory of the Ancien Régime while also calling for “national rejuvenation”. This bizarre blending of the old and the new was, fittingly, broadcast on radio and television for all French people to see and hear.\n\nHaving achieved this position by making their particular brand of monarchy as vague and inclusive as possible, it is, as of yet, unknown which of the three major royal families, the Bourbons, the Orléanists, or the Bonapartes, will be crowned. What is certain is that the Third Republic is now, officially, dead."
 
 france_far_right.2.desc:0 "It started at the crack of dawn. In every city in France, thousands of black-clad men and women took to the streets, waving black banners with a white cross and skull on them and chanting “Social d'abord!” At first it was assumed that this was just one of the many protests that the government faces on a monthly basis.\n\nBut from the start, this was something more.\n\nForming in the outlying suburbs and villages and then moving inwards to be joined by Parisians, a huge procession of supporters of the Croix-de-Fue began to make their way into the city, spearheaded by veterans of the Great War who were armed with antiquated rifles and pistols.\n\nThe Ground Army has explicitly refused to aid the government, apparently unwilling to shoot at their former comrades in arms. The Paris police and gendarmes held out for several hours, assisted, in a strange twist of fate, by several socialist and communist militias, but were eventually forced back by the sheer size of the crown. Street-fighting was fierce, but was mostly close-quarters, with clubs and fists, and so deaths were few and far between.\n\nOnce the crowd reached the Palais du Luxembourg and the Palais Bourbon, they surrounded the buildings and presented their sole demand: That their leader, François de La Rocque, be named as president of the republic.\n\nFaced with a mob hundreds of thousands strong, and with the armed forces standing idly by, the government felt that they had no choice but to acquiesce to the demand.\n\nSo ends the current iteration of Europe’s grandest republic; brought down in the same manner as Italy was. We can only hope that the new regime does not emulate their Roman counterparts too closely."

They swiftly took control of strategic locations across the country and established a provisional government, promising to address the social and economic grievances of the working class and other marginalized groups.\n\nThe military, having been disarmed by the previous, paranoid government, offered no resistance, allowing the rebels to take control of the country without any bloodshed.\n\nThe success of the coup has sent shockwaves across France and the international community, with some expressing concerns about the implications of the revolution for the future of the country.\n\nAs the situation continues to evolve, the fate of France and its people hangs in the balance, with the revolutionaries working to consolidate their power and implement their vision for a new social order."

However, the tides of change have swept over the nation, subverting the established order. The helm of the Republic is now firmly in the grasp of the new Regent, Charles Maurras, and one can only wonder where this ship shall travel.\n\n This Regency has not come without detractors, as supporters of the previous regime have taken not only to the streets, but to arms in resistance against what may be claimed to be the death of French democracy as a whole. Metropolitan Police Officers are swamped in reports of borderline insurrectionist behaviour, with cells of Republicans having taken over local armouries and strategic locations throughout the nation."
