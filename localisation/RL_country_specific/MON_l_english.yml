 POLITICS_REGENCY_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "In 1919, a rogue Chinese general invaded Mongolia to end its bid for independence. A harsh year of Chinese rule followed. Then, Mongolia’s savior, Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, swept down from the north, yet another rogue general with grand plans. Sternberg defeated the Chinese with help from local Mongol troops and restored an independent Mongolia with Bogd Khan restored to the throne. From there, they led as something of a diarchy. Sternberg, still a general in the Russian Army, was also in charge of the Mongolian military, and the true power-broker of the country. However, Bogd Khan was a respected and revered leader who gave the government a level of legitimacy and stability that the Bloody Baron could never replicate. This match made in heaven secured an independent Mongolia with Russian support years. However, after Bogd Khan died in 1926, the country became ruled by a regency council, which in effect gave Sternberg free reign of the country. In the decade since, Mongolia has become and increasingly lawless and tumultuous place, as Sternberg rampaged across the country with his cavalry units, hunting down and killing suspected Jews and communists and terrorizing the population. The Mongolian clergy and aristocracy have become increasingly disgruntled with the madman’s reign, and if something doesn’t change soon, Mongolia may become an even more dangerous place."
