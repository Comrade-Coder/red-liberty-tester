 POLITICS_CHARLES_VYNER_BROOKE_DESC:0 "How is it that a white man, born in London, educated at Winchester College, has come to rule as an absolute monarch an Indonesian Raj on the far side of the world? The story begins with British adventurer James Brooke, who, for his service to the Sultan of Brunei, was granted dominion over Kuching, and the title of Rajah. He would pass his title onto his nephew, Charles Brooke, who would in turn pass it onto his own son, Charles Vyner Brooke, with the territory of the realm expanding all the while.\n\nSince inheriting the throne in 1917, Brooke has largely continued his father's hands-off and relatively popular administration, ruling in tandem with his brother Bertram. An economic boom in the rubber and oil industries early in his rule has allowed him to modernise the country's institutions, including the public service, and introduce a penal code developed on British Indian lines. Despite this modernisation, he has done much to foster native traditions (though the ban on headhunting remains in force) and keep Christian missionaries at bay."
