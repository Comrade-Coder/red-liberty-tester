 IRE_michael_collins:0 "Michael Collins"
 POLITICS_MICHAEL_COLLINS_DESC:0 "Regarded by many as a traitor to Ireland but by more as the undisputed founder of the Irish Republic, Michael Collins is a divisive man. As a young man and former accountant, Mick joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, and would serve as a soldier of the Provisional Irish Republic during the Easter Rising just three years later. He was known for his tactical mind and fiery patriotism, for both of which he became a close friend and confidant to Seán MacDiarmada in the years after the failed Rising. Following the death of MacDiarmada in 1918, Collins was not only the man to proclaim the First Dáil and to assume a position as the President of the new Irish Republic, but was one of the revolution’s greatest military minds, revolutionising guerrilla warfare, infiltrating the British Intelligence Service, and ultimately being called to negotiate for the independence of Ireland in 1920 as the Great War was finally nearing its end.\n\nHoping to avoid any further instability for the new Republic, Collins won for 26 counties complete independence, but ceded 6 of the most militantly Protestant counties in Ulster to the UK, ironically causing the Irish Civil War while the Republic was still in its infancy. In the aftermath, political opponents of Collins and sympathisers with ICA and IRA rebels found themselves all but completely excluded from the Dáil, and commonly discriminated against by law. In the end, The Big Fella emerged from the Revolutionary Period of Irish history with a stranglehold on the new Irish government, and is now nearing the end of his second term as Taoiseach, widely expected to gain a third."

 IRE_anglo_irish_trade_war_desc:0 "Taking the form of unilateral trade restrictions and outrageous tariffs between Ireland and Britain, the Irish economy and the livelihoods of its people have suffered much from the Trade War. The restrictions themselves considered the result of Na Chéad Laochra’s protectionist economic policy and the refusal of the Irish government to reimburse Britain for loans granted to tenant farmers prior to the establishment of the Irish Republic, the worst sufferers of the Trade War are ironically the same farmers which Collins’ party sought to protect."

Whether these groups be holdovers from the Revolutionary Years of Irish history just a few decades ago or entirely new factions formed in response to Collins’ government, they have become known for their vigilante justice and shows of force on both sides of the Irish border. Revolutionary violence has increased in recent years as a result of many Socialist and hardline Nationalist leaders being released from their long sentences for taking part in the Civil War just 13 years ago."

 ireland.2.desc:0 "Cathal Brugha, hero of the War of Independence and Easter Rising, first Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann, and former Chief of Staff of the Irish Republican Army, has finally been released from his long stay in Mountjoy Prison following his arrest in November of 1924 in connection with the Civil War half a year prior. On his release, Brugha was met by a crowd of ardent supporters and made a small speech thanking those gathered for their concern, but thereafter quickly left the scene. Ever the restrained revolutionary, it is unknown what role Brugha might play in the mounting division of Ireland, and some debate whether he’ll play a role at all, but the same government which locked him up years ago is certainly keeping a close eye on this hero of the people."

They emphasized the need for unity in the face of economic challenges and political uncertainties both at home and abroad.\n\nLemass, a prominent figure in the nationalist movement, expressed his admiration for the Labour Party's dedication to social justice and workers' rights. He acknowledged that their mutual goals far outweighed any ideological differences, and that this alliance represented a significant step toward a more unified and inclusive Ireland.\n\nNorton, in turn, praised Díle Saor's contributions to the fight for Irish independence and affirmed the Labour Party's commitment to a progressive, forward-looking Ireland.

When a loud pop was heard from below the stage, Hyde stopped to begin a meandering joke about faulty construction, but was unable to finish it when the stage erupted from beneath him, the blast and debris grievously injuring several dozen audience members and heavily damaging the Theatre Royal.\n\nAuthorities quickly arrived on the scene, and Douglas Hyde, along with two members of the audience and one performer, were found to have been killed on impact. Already the local Gardaí have stated that they suspect an explosive was planted under the stage by a ‘political dissident,’ but they are not taking further questions at this time. The death of Douglas Hyde occurring just three weeks prior to the 1937 General Election, Taoiseach Michael Collins has called a state of emergency, indefinitely suspending the election until the culprit and any accomplices to the killing of Douglas Hyde have been found, and until a new President has been selected by the Presidential Commission. Collins has publicly vowed retribution for the death of this great Irishman."

Reports of a ‘Second Limerick Soviet’ being declared are numerous, alongside accounts of small towns and city quarters being occupied by rebel forces claiming the allegiance of various, disjointed governments.

A semblance of order has been restored, but the bombed out buildings and reports of atrocities on all sides seem likely to leave deeper scars than the First Irish Civil War ever did.

 #ireland.10.desc:0 "Shocking news has emerged today from the former Republic of Ireland. Over months of infighting, the Irish Republic was rent into a state of warlordism and anarchy, with government forces collapsing and unable to contain the spread of revolution or the ire of its own people. Eventually, the Irish Citizen Army took power in cities across the country, before sweeping into the countryside. Now in control of Dublin, the political heart of the country, and dealing only with sparse resistance, a group calling itself the ‘Irish Citizen Army Council’, headed by one Jack White, has announced from Liberty Hall the establishment of the Confederation of Irish Soviets, 'a new political order which values chiefly worker solidarity and national Irish liberty.'"

 #ireland.12.desc:0 "Surprising news has emerged today from the 'Easter Republic of Ireland'. As the Irish Republic devolved into deeper and more divisive infighting, and government forces proved incapable of keeping the country united, the remaining forces of the Irish Republican Army emerged to unite disgruntled rebels under its banner across the country. Despite resistance from Socialist and government forces both, the IRA seized much of the country through subsidiary groups before taking Dublin directly. A new government was quickly proclaimed by one Seamus O’Donovan from the steps of the GPO, invoking the imagery of the Easter Rising just two decades ago, which claims to be the provisional continuation of that government which was proclaimed in arms on Easter Monday in 1916."
