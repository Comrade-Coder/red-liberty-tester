 ### Ideas ###
 ETH_resist_and_fight:0 "Resist and Fight"
 ETH_resist_and_fight_desc:0 "In 1896, the Italians invaded our land. The so-called great powers watched on, expecting us to roll over and fall like the rest of Africa. But we refused, we would not be the same! Against all odds, we delivered the Italians a crushing defeat at the Battle of Adwa. Evidently, that embarassment did not teach them anything.\n\nNow, 40 years later, they have returned. We beat the Italians before, and we shall do so again!"
 ETH_conservative_high_command:0 "Conservative High Command"
 ETH_conservative_high_command_desc:0 "The nobles that make up our military hierarchy are not innovators by nature. They stick to mass infantry tactics that, while effective against minor warlords and other noble's armies, are not so effective against machine gun emplacements and artillery batteries."
 ETH_1931_constitution:0 "The 1931 Constitution"
 ETH_1931_constitution_desc:0 "In 1931, Emperor Selassie promulgated the first modern constitution in Ethiopian history. Replacing the Fetha Nagast, which had been the supreme law of the land since the Middle Ages, it established a bicameral parliament and began the process of constitutionalization of imperial institutions.\n\nAn impressive document, to be sure, but certainly a flawed one. The emperor's position is supreme; all power over central and local government, the legislature, the judiciary, and the military is vested in him alone. Our nation is not a representative democracy, it is not intended to be."
