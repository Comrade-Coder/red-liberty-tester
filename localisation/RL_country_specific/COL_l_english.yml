 COL_legacy_bolivar:0 "Legacy of Bolivar"
 COL_legacy_bolivar_desc:0 "The center of the Bolivarian revolution, the Bolivar republic of Colombia has been gutted from it's own destiny to rival the North Americans and European imperialists abroad, with the internal disorder caused by bickering administrators outside Bogota succumbing to the wills of political independence, with the final national concession of Panama forcibly sponsored by the Americans sealing our fate as another south American state. Many however, especially within the military echelons, seek to dispute this notion at all, contending that Colombia is destined to carry the mantle of Bolivar in the 21st century, either through diplomatic racketeering, or through a show of force."
