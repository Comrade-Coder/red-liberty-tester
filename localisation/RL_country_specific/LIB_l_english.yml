 POLITICS_THOMAS_FAULKNER_DESC:0 "A man of integrity, ambition and innovation, Thomas J. R. Faulkner was born in 1869 in the American state of North Carolina. An engineer by trade, he immigrated to the Republic of Liberia in 1881, setting up business in the capital of Monrovia and establishing himself as an entrepreneur. Faulkner set up the widely popular "TJR Faulkner Ice Cream and Confectionery" company, eventually using his newly gained wealth to build the first telephone stations seen in the country. His quick rise to fame attracted the attention of the reigning True Whig Party, who embraced Faulkner into their ranks due to his American heritage.\n\nAppointed Mayor of Monrovia, Faulker held the position throughout the First World War, rebuilding the city after the German Navy bombarded it. Faulkner eventually split from the True Whig Party, allying himself with Marcus Garvey's UNIA and various opposition leaders. On the declining People's Party ticket, he ran for the Presidency, losing a rigged election to incumbent President Charles D. B. King. The unrest after the election led to Faulkner exposing President King's involvement in the slave trade, leading to his impeachment. Following King's impeachment, the courts declared Faulkner the winner of the election due to a mix of American pressure and the threat of rebellion. Faulkner's years in office have led to drastic changes in the nation's governance, much to the dismay of the still powerful True Whig Party. The biggest change in his administration was his split with the powerful Garveyite movement, with Faulkner deeming the increasingly radical views of Marcus Garvey too drastic for Liberia. Still widely popular, the elderly Faulkner is reaching the end of his term, with many wondering who will succeed the reformer President and if they will live up to his legacy."
