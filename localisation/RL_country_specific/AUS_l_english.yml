 POLITICS_KARL_I_DESC:0 "Born in a castle in 1887, Karl I was a Hapsburg, and raised a devout Catholic. He was also raised so he could become a noble, and lived in Vienna for some time. He would join the army in 1906 and would study law and politics around the same time. He was not close with his uncle, Franz Ferdinand, but following his death, he became the heir of Austria-Hungary, and would become the Emperor in 1916 following the death of Franz Joseph. Despite a cold that developed into pneumonia that nearly killed him, he has remained healthy since and currently remains the leader of Austria, but he is struggling with internal issues in his empire thanks to the ethnic groups and socialist riots in the streets. The flames of revolution are growing, and he must do his best to prevent a full blown revolution and the collapse of his country. God save the Emperor."
