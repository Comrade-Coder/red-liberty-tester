 BAL_ethnic_conflict:0 "Unnatural Foundation"
 BAL_ethnic_conflict_desc:0 "The United Baltic Duchy is not a natural development, not in the way that most European nation-states are. The Baltic region is home to 5 main ethnic groups, who historically have been in a state of total war. Now, within the duchy, the ethnicities are forced to unite. There is absolute hatred for one another among the ethic groups. Ethnic violence is a daily occurance. In border towns there are reports of hundreds being killed regularly. The only reason the groups haven't broken away is due to the draconian German laws. The current situation will be an existential problem for any united Baltic nation."
 BAL_militaristic_society:0 "Militaristic Society"
 BAL_militaristic_society_desc:0 "The leadership of the duchy for all of its history has been centered around military rule. The government has been making a new united Baltic culture around military might and strength. As the homelands of the Prussian people we must continue this plan. The only way to have this nation is to play with mankind's jingoistic spirit."
