 MEX_laborist_dominance:0 "Laborist Dominance"
 MEX_laborist_dominance_desc:0 "The Mexican Laborist Party is the political arm of the country’s most powerful trade union, the Regional Confederation of Mexican Workers. Since their victory in the 1920 elections, the Laborist party has gone on to secure complete control of the Mexican state. The political elite have either fallen into line or been removed and replaced with party loyalists."
 MEX_united_front:0 "The Mexican United Front"
 MEX_united_front_desc:0 "The United Front is an informal alliance of leftist parties and trade-unions that is coordinated and organized by the Laborist Party. Officially, they all work together to keep reactionaries at bay and build a better Mexico.\n\nIn reality, the United Front is merely a puppet organization of the Laborist Party, designed and administered for the sole purpose of suppressing and subsuming all political opposition, including the nascent Mexican Communist Party, radical unions, and the various local Zapatist groups throughout the country.\n\nCurrently the Laborists reign supreme, intent on turning Mexico into a secular social democracy. but if the county were subjected to a major shock their control over the Front may falter, and another group could rise to take the helm."
 MEX_radical_christians:0 "Radical Christians"
 MEX_radical_christians_desc:0 "The 1917 Constitution of Mexico established what can be argued to be a regime of state atheism; various religious freedoms have been restricted and religious organization, most especially the Catholic Church, have been cracked down on.\n\nIn the devout center of the country, this has led inevitably to great resentment, especially in the state of Jalisco. There have been murders of federal officials, and rumors are mounting that weapons, ammunition, and supplies are being stockpiled. Mexico is a tinderbox, and all that is required is a spark…"

 POLITICS_PLUTARCO_ELIAS_CALLES_DESC:0 "Plutarco Elías Calles, born on September 25, 1877, in Guaymas, Sonora, emerged as a central figure in the political landscape of Mexico during the tumultuous years following the Mexican Revolution. A charismatic and pragmatic leader, Calles rose to prominence as a military general and became a driving force in shaping the destiny of his nation.\n\nCalles' political career began as a revolutionary officer, fighting alongside figures like Pancho Villa and Álvaro Obregón. However, it was his strategic acumen and organizational skills that set him apart. After the assassination of President Obregón in 1928, Calles assumed the presidency and embarked on an ambitious agenda to modernize and stabilize Mexico.\n\nThe Calles era saw the implementation of sweeping reforms, focusing on land redistribution, educational advancements, and industrial development. His administration worked tirelessly to bridge the socio-economic gaps that had long plagued Mexico. The introduction of agrarian reforms sought to address land inequalities, while educational initiatives aimed to elevate the country's literacy levels and foster intellectual growth.\n\nKnown for his pragmatic approach to governance, Calles maintained a delicate balance between nationalism and diplomacy. He prioritized economic self-sufficiency, implementing policies that protected Mexican industries and natural resources. This approach garnered both praise and criticism, domestically and internationally, but it undeniably left a lasting impact on the nation.\n\nPlutarco Elías Calles' rule extended beyond the presidency, as he continued to influence Mexican politics through his role as the power behind the scenes. His tenure marked a period of significant transformation, establishing the foundations for a modern and industrialized Mexico."
