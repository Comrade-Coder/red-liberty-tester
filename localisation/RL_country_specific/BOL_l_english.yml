 ### Ideas ###
 BOL_chaco_generation:0 "Generación del Chaco"
 BOL_chaco_generation_desc:0 "In 1825, when Bolivia declared itself an independent republic, it did so from a dominant position. With the exception of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico, it was the largest Ibero-American country; it had, for its time, a dense population far superior in number to that of Argentina, Chile or Venezuela.\n\nHumiliation after humiliation ensued, and by 1935, Bolivia was a mere shadow of its former glory. The disaster that was the Chaco War was the final straw; from the conflict, a new generation would emerge.\n\nThe Chaco Generation, as it is called, has charged that the traditional politicians and the international oil companies had led Bolivia into its ruinous war, and have increasingly associated with more radical parties and politics."
 BOL_legion_of_veterans:0 "The Legion of Veterans"
 BOL_legion_of_veterans_desc:0 "Soon after the end of the Chaco War, local veterans' organizations began to spring up across the country, spanning the entire breadth of the ideological spectrum. The meteoric rise to prominence of these veterans' organizations quickly resulted in the formation of the Legion of Veterans as a national organization on the 13th of September, 1935.\n\nNow led by one Lieutenant Colonel Germán Busch, the Legion has an offical stance of apoliticalism, though this is less of an anti-party stance, and more of a willingness to align with any party able to give the veterans what they want."
