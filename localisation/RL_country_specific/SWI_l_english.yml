 POLITICS_ERNST_NOBS_DESC:0 "Born the son of a master tailor in 1886 in Seedorf, Ernst Nobs was taught the value of skilled work from a young age. However, despite his father’s wishes, Ernst would not follow in the family business, instead feeling called to education and training as a primary teacher in Hofwil in his early career, and subsequently spending his late 20s teaching in Wynau and Ostermundigen. Throughout his work in education, Nobs felt called to the Socialist cause and became quickly involved in the Social Democratic Party, until in 1912 becoming the editor of both the Freie Innerschweiz and Volksstimme newspapers, and in 1915 being made the the editor-in-chief of the largest Social Democrat newspaper in Switzerland, the Volksrecht, while the Swiss Socialist movement began to see tremendous growth. When the Landesstreik, comprising nearly 400,000 workers, began on the 12th of November, 1918, Nobs found himself as the figurehead of the Zurich general strike. Despite the remobilisation of the Swiss military to quell the strike before it had even begun, and the initial refusal of the Swiss government to accept the demands of the general strike, after more than a week of striking the Olten Action Committee was eventually called to negotiate. The Federal Assembly was unwilling to meet many demands of the OAK, but realising the strike could not continue for much longer, the OAK took what ground they could and an agreement was made. In the resulting snap election, the National Council saw an unprecedented influx of Social Democratic Party candidates, and in 1928 Nobs was elected as representative of this new faction in the Federal Council. Since then, Nobs has served three terms as President of the Swiss Confederation, once in 1929 and again in 1932 and 1935, but has only begun to face increased opposition from his colleagues in the Federal Council as his tenure has gone on."
 POLITICS_MARCEL_PILET_GOLAZ_DESC:0 "The son of wealthy French-speaking businessman and Municipal Council President Edouard Pilet, Marcel was born in 1889, Cossonay, and always seemed destined for politics. Graduating from the University of Lausanne in 1912 with a doctorate in law, Marcel worked for a period as a lawyer, briefly served in the Swiss army as an officer and, later, major (during which time he met his wife, Mathilde Golaz, from whom he earned the second half of his surname), and would eventually come to serve on the Grand Council of the Canton of Vaud in 1921, and on the National Council in 1925. In 1926, Pilet-Golaz earned a reputation as a pragmatic and accommodating negotiator, and he distinguished himself in 1926 by sitting down against the right of civil servants to strike. In 1926, amid the largest Social Democrat majority ever seen in the Federal Assembly and following the surprise resignation of Ernest Chaud, Marcel was appointed to the Federal Council, and in 1930 was appointed President of the Swiss Confederation for the first time, serving again in 1933, and now in 1936. Each of Pilet-Golaz’s terms has followed that of fellow councilor Ernst Nobs, and it seems with each term he has pushed back harder against the agenda set by his colleague, his own policy and speeches becoming increasingly authoritarian in his attempt at limiting the influence of Socialism in Switzerland. Time will tell, however, just how deep the rift between them, and how confused Swiss foreign policy, becomes."
 POLITICS_PHILIPP_ETTER_DESC:0 "Born the youngest of four siblings in 1891 in the Catholic municipality of Menzingen, Philipp Etter was a devout Catholic, attending school first at the Cantonal School of Zug but later studying at the Einsiedeln Monastery, from which he graduated as a law student in 1911. Etter was editor of the Conservative newspaper ‘Zuger Nachrichten’ during his studies, and made a name for himself by continuing to publish many Catholic, Conservative political works during his early career. In 1918, Etter was elected to the Canton Council of Schwyz, and was elected to the Council of States for Zug in 1927. A rising star in the political world, although one who seemed to align increasingly with Italy, Etter was first elected to the Federal Council in 1929 following the sudden heart attack and death of Giuseppe Motta, and then as President of the Swiss Confederation on 1931 and 1934, each term following the tenure of Pilet-Golaz and preceding that of Nobs. Throughout his time on the Federal Council, Etter has been seen repeatedly as something of a middle-ground between the forces of Ernst and Marcel despite personally leaning far more toward the cause of one than the other. Still, with the Federal Council unwilling to break the balance of power, Etter has been hoisted up twice in the vain hope that he might reconcile some of the division."

 SWI_carousel:0 "Die Galionsfigur Karussell"
 SWI_carousel_desc:0 "Since 1929, the Presidency of the Federal Council has been occupied by the same three men, Ernst Nobs, Marcel Pilet-Golaz, and Philipp Etter, rotating in perpetuity. This political merry-go-round, fittingly coined the ‘Galionsfigur Karussell,’ is admittedly not a matter of the gravest importance, but is nonetheless a divisive issue among the Federal Assembly. Still, however much some may wish to break the cycle, for the past two terms of the Federal Administration these three figureheads have invariably all been made council members by the Federal Assembly, and each has been appointed President twice or more in that time. With the divided Federal Council unwilling to break the cycle and possibly hand more influence to the enemy, many believe the Karussell is poised to continue for some time, which is made worse by the increasingly divisive rhetoric each successive President in the cycle seems to be using against his peers, and the confused messaging of the government as a result."
 SWI_intricate_system:0 "Intricate System"
 SWI_intricate_system_desc:0 "The Swiss Confederation’s system of government, in place in nearly its exact form since 1848, is a staggeringly complex and efficient system of direct representation, consisting of a single federal state, 26 cantons, and 2,636 communities. Within this framework, the members of the bicameral Federal Assembly are elected every four years by the people, but a public referendum is nonetheless mandatory for any change in the constitution and is often held for any change in law. More than that, the people at large act as the guardians of the rule of law due to the absence of a constitutional court. More intricately, the people are given a direct say in the budgetary matters, infrastructure, and government initiatives for their community, canton, and state. This system has led to a highly stable and well-liked form of government, but one which is nonetheless dizzyingly complex and can be slow to make critical decisions."
 SWI_disorganized_defense:0 "Disorganised Defence"
 SWI_disorganized_defense_desc:0 "The Swiss people have, for quite some time, been ever-willing to assert their independence with guns and explosives should any foreign power dare to violate their careful neutrality. Still, as eager as some are to back up their government’s international neutrality with force, it cannot be said that the Swiss military or plans of defence are as developed for the modern day as they perhaps should be. With mounting tensions in Europe, many have come to fear an imminent invasion of Switzerland by some expansionist world power, and there have been increasing calls for a modernisation of the army. Ironically, however, the same system of direct democracy which puts the Federal Assembly so in touch with the concerns of its people also prevents most meaningful military reorganisation."
