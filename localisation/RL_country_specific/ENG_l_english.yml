 ### IDEAS ###
 ENG_puppet_minister:0 "Puppet Minister"
 ENG_puppet_minister_desc:0 "The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is Ramsay MacDonald, the first labour Prime Minister for Britain and a supposed socialist. However all is not what it seems. MacDonald was forced to cut unemployment benefits after the Pound stock crisis in 1931 which caused a civil war in labour, dividing the party in two and splitting the vote in two between two labour parties.\n\nTo remain in power MacDonald has entered into a coalition government with Stanley Baldwin’s Conservatives who have enough MP’s to run a majority government in Britain. However it suits Baldwin to keep his enemies divided and controlled by him whilst also having the blame of governance directed to MacDonald which has resulted to the labour Prime Minister playing second fiddle to Stanley Baldwin."
 ENG_rivers_of_blood:0 "Fields of Blood"
 ENG_rivers_of_blood_desc:0 "We were told that the war in France against the Hun would be a quick endeavour, told by our betters that we would be home by Christmas. We didn’t return home for six bloody years. Brutal trench warfare forced over a million British and Commonwealth men to perish in the fields of Flanders and the Somme for absolutely nothing. By 1918 our tactics changed to holding the line against the reinforced Germans after the collapse of Russia in the East. To not dishonor the tommy’s who died in those trenches, we held the line and we suffered for it.\n\nNow the scars of the Great War are sown upon the fabric of the nation. Many young men born after the war grew up with fathers without limbs or sight due to the horrors of that war and the stories told by those men has made any idea of a major conflict extremely unpopular across the nation."
 ENG_imperial_economics:0 "Reliance on Imperial Economics"
 ENG_imperial_economics_desc:0 "The Pound Sterling crash in 1931 finally brought the recession to Britain which covers most of the western world. However, unlike the rest of the world, we have one advantage: the Empire. Our trade with our Dominions and Colonies lessened the burden on the British economy and saw a relatively quick recovery. This has come as a price however, businesses in Britain have now moved to places such as Canada which has seen our own industrial capacity decrease in favour of reliance on the Empire. This saw our shipping trade boost and the importance of the Royal navy once more in return for large scale unemployment as businesses moved to other realms."
 ENG_unemployment_crisis:0 "Unemployment Crisis"
 ENG_unemployment_crisis_desc:0 "With our economy recovering from the 31 Stirling crash; all should seem calm. This is not the case. The reliance on imports from the Empire has seen many jobs move to the Dominions and to Colonies where labour is cheap. This has seen massive figures in unemployment in many industrial centers in the British north centered around the British North in cities such as Glasgow, Newport and Manchester.\n\nThe Reliance on Imperial trade and the growing unemployment situation has seen many race riots against those not considered English in these areas which has been capitalised by the Communist party who have recruited many new members in the industrial heartland for Britain. If the Government does not rectify the situation quickly, a red rising may happen in Britain unless the workers of the North are given jobs."

Starting in 1931, he headed a National Government dominated by the Conservative Party and supported by only a few Labour members.\n\nMacDonald is in the last years of his life and has limited time to influence the United Kingdom before his passing. Unwilling to allow the political stability of the United Kingdom to collapse in such a strenuous time, Ramsay will not resign his position."
