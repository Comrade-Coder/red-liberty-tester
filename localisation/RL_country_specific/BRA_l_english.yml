 BRA_getulio_vargas:0 "Getúlio Vargas"
 POLITICS_GETULIO_VARGAS_DESC:0 "Getulio Vargas is the current president of Brazil. He was born in 1882 to a rich family in Rio Grande do Sul in a border town, somewhat infamous for its high crime rate. His family was not uninvolved with such violence, as a brother of his was accused of committing two assassinations on Argentinian officials. Vargas, like his father before him, served in the Brazilian army and fought for Brazilian forces in 1903 against Bolivia in a border crisis. He would leave the army and enroll in a law school afterwards, working as an attorney until civil war broke out in 1923. He returned to the army fighting for the Republicans, and fought well, becoming incredibly popular. In 1930, he ran for office in the country, but lost, so he launched a coup d’etat with the help of the military to seize power. He would initiate economic reforms, but this angered a certain Luis Prestes, who revolted with the help of his rebels. Vargas must now deal with another civil war—it all comes down to him."

 BRA_civil_war:0 "Brazilian Civil War"
 BRA_civil_war_desc:0 "Our Civil War has raged now for over a year, and we are soon to gain the upper hand; support pours from abroad and our soldiers take key strategic positions by the day. Our side shall be victorious and it is only a matter of time before we are home with our families to celebrate the success of our one true, legitimate, government!"
 BRA_right_wing_coalition:0 "Right-Wing Coalition"
 BRA_right_wing_coalition_desc:0 "There are many points during a Civil War where unity is absolutely key, the dire situation faced by the Rightist Forces spread out inside the borders of what was once Brazil is absolutely one of them. Unable to make use of their industry, forced to deal with squabbling generals and returning exiles with radical ideas, always under the watchful eye of Uncle Sam, it is unlikely this coalition will survive should any conflict be waged inside the ranks. But… for the most ambitious of leaders, this incredible instability and weak leadership may just be the perfect moment to establish themselves as the future leadership of White Brazil."
